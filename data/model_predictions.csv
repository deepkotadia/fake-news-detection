Shot Sage Blue Marilyn has set a record as stunning as the actress it depicts. One of Andy Warhol's many silkscreened representations of Marilyn Monroe was auctioned by Christie's in New York for $195 million. The price, which includes fees, is the highest for a 20th century artwork sold at auction and the highest for an American artwork, topping the $179.4 million mark in 2015 for Pablo Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O) and $110.5 million in 2017 for a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat. The name of the buyer of Shot Sage Blue Marilyn was not announced. Warhol's works have long been among the most coveted by collectors of American art, along with Basquiat, Roy Lichtenstein and Mark Rothko. But Warhol's Marilyn series carries a singular cultural mystique. Starting in 1964, Warhol churned out more than a dozen portraits of the actress, all based on an image from taken from one of Monroe's more forgettable films, Niagara, from 1953. ""Once you see the image, you will recognize that you're actually much more familiar with Warhol's vision of Marilyn than with the old movie shots from Marilyn herself,"" said Alex Rotter, chairman of 20th and 21st Century Art at Christie's, to Morning Edition last week. The final price may be as eyepopping as Warhol's candy-colored palette. But Shot Sage Blue Marilyn is not even the most expensive 20th century painting ever sold. A Willem De Kooning piece called Interchange sold for $300 million in 2015 to a hedge fund manager who also picked up a nice Jackson Pollock for $200 million.",True,90.0,,

Posted on Jul 1, 2020 Developing an extension for chrome is very easy and doable with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We are building simple extension that reads an API from Breaking Bad quotes and shows it, that is it. We need to create few files to have a chrome extension index.html, manifest.json ,script.js and a png file for your icon. You can add style.css file and link it but I am keeping this as simple as possible. This is a JSON file that contains data about your extension. Most of its attributes are self explanatory. Here is a full example of our extension manifest.json Please note that manifest_version, name and version are required. Most important part here is browser_action. This is where you tell chrome where to find file to open and icon to have in chrome. This markup is going to to have a header and a section to have our quote after API calling is done In our index.html we have imported script.js file. This file is going to call https://breaking-bad-quotes.herokuapp.com/v1/quotes and get a random Breaking Bad quote. Here is the script for our extension This is s simple drag and drop step. But before make sure you have enabled developer mode in your browser. Then head to chrome://extensions/ and drag the folder where all files in and drop inside extensions tab. That is it. The full code is found in this repo. Templates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use. Are you sure you want to hide this comment?

Posted on Jul 1, 2020 Developing an extension for chrome is very easy and doable with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We are building simple extension that reads an API from Breaking Bad quotes and shows it, that is it. We need to create few files to have a chrome extension index.html, manifest.json ,script.js and a png file for your icon. You can add style.css file and link it but I am keeping this as simple as possible. This is a JSON file that contains data about your extension. Most of its attributes are self explanatory. Here is a full example of our extension manifest.json Please note that manifest_version, name and version are required. Most important part here is browser_action. This is where you tell chrome where to find file to open and icon to have in chrome. This markup is going to to have a header and a section to have our quote after API calling is done In our index.html we have imported script.js file. This file is going to call https://breaking-bad-quotes.herokuapp.com/v1/quotes and get a random Breaking Bad quote. Here is the script for our extension This is s simple drag and drop step. But before make sure you have enabled developer mode in your browser. Then head to chrome://extensions/ and drag the folder where all files in and drop inside extensions tab. That is it.

The Italian Foreign Ministry says 63 Ukrainian orphans will be flown today from Krakow, Poland to Trapani, Sicily. The transport was organised by the Pope John XXIII Community, along with Italian diplomats in Ukraine and Poland. Some 37,000 minors, many accompanied by family members, have arrived in Italy since Russia launched its invasion. The U.S. House emphatically approved a fresh $40 billion Ukraine aid package on Tuesday as lawmakers beefed up President Joe Biden’s initial request, signalling a magnified, bipartisan commitment to thwart Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bloody three-month-old invasion. Read more news on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis here. Here are the latest updates: The European Union (EU) on May 10 accused the Russian authorities of carrying out a cyberattack against a satellite network an hour before the invasion of Ukraine to pave the way for its assault. It marked the first time the EU has formally blamed the Russian authorities for carrying out a cyberattack, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Tuesday reopened her country’s embassy in Kyiv that was closed more than two months ago following the Russian invasion. Baerbock, the first German Cabinet member to visit Ukraine since the start of the war, also pledged that Berlin would provide further support to Kyiv, including when it comes to investigating and prosecuting war crimes. - AP The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on May 10 for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the world organisation’s leading human rights body following its suspension over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The Czech Republic was the only candidate for the seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council. Seats on the Geneva-based council are divided among regional groups and a replacement for Russia had to come from an East European country. - AP The House emphatically approved a fresh $40 billion Ukraine aid package on May 10 as lawmakers beefed up President Joe Biden’s initial request, signalling a magnified, bipartisan commitment to thwart Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bloody three-month-old invasion. The measure sailed to passage by a lopsided 368-57 margin, providing $7 billion more than Biden’s request from April and dividing the increase evenly between defence and humanitarian programmes. The bill would give Ukraine military and economic assistance, help regional allies, replenish weapons the Pentagon has shipped overseas and provide $5 billion to address global food shortages caused by the war’s crippling of Ukraine’s normally robust production of many crops. Russia pummeled the vital port of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on May 10, in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines and Western weapons shipments critical to Kyiv’s defence. Ukraine’s ability to stymie a larger, better-armed Russian military has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker end to the conflict. With the war now in its 11th week and Kyiv bogging down Russian forces and even staging a counteroffensive, Ukraine’s foreign minister appeared to suggest the country could expand its aims beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the February 24 invasion. - AP Top U.S. intelligence officials were questioned on May 10 about why they misjudged the durability of governments in both Afghanistan and Ukraine, and whether they need to reform how intelligence agencies assess a foreign military’s will to fight.

In Nebraska, Jim Pillen has won the Republican primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press. Riding the endorsement of Gov. Pete Ricketts and much of the state's GOP establishment, Pillen, a hog producer and University of Nebraska regent, held off rival candidates that included Charles Herbster – a political newcomer backed by former President Donald Trump – and State Sen. Brett Lindstrom. Pillen's win is a loss for Trump and the power of his endorsement, which has seemed to push other Republicans in prominent primaries to victory this year, including in West Virginia Tuesday and in Ohio last week. Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., came to Nebraska to campaign for Herbster, a wealthy businessman who donated $11.5 million of his own money to his campaign. The stump speeches and spending weren't enough to beat Pillen in the end, who raised $8.4 million. Herbster could have suffered among voters after the Nebraska Examiner published a story detailing allegations from eight women that he groped or forcibly kissed them. Herbster later filed a defamation lawsuit against state Sen. Julie Slama, one of the accusers. Slama has filed a countersuit. Pillen, meanwhile, campaigned on his opposition to abortion rights and critical race theory. He also says he supports restricted government and making Nebraska more friendly to agricultural business.

""Guess where the grass is the greenest and the tallest,"" Pillen said at a rally on Monday, ""right here in Nebraska."" Like Herbster and other candidates in the race, Pillen says as governor he would push back against policies from Washington D.C. and fight any COVID-19 mandates. The Republican will face Democrat Carol Blood in the November general elections. Blood, a Nebraska state senator, cruised to victory Tuesday night. Her challenger Roy Harris made very few public campaign appearances. Pillen is widely expected to take office in November.

Recently passed laws make abortion illegal after about six weeks into a pregnancy. As the Supreme Court appears poised to return abortion regulation to the states, recent experience in Texas illustrates that medical care for miscarriages and dangerous ectopic pregnancies would also be threatened if restrictions become more widespread. One Texas law passed last year lists several medications as abortion-inducing drugs and largely bars their use for abortion after the seventh week of pregnancy. But two of those drugs, misoprostol and mifepristone, are the only drugs recommended in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for treating a patient after an early pregnancy loss. The other miscarriage treatment is a procedure described as surgical uterine evacuation to remove the pregnancy tissue — the same approach as for an abortion. ""The challenge is that the treatment for an abortion and the treatment for a miscarriage are exactly the same,"" said Dr. Sarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington in Seattle and an expert in early pregnancy loss. Miscarriages occur in roughly 1 out of 10 pregnancies. Some people experience loss of pregnancy at home and don't require additional care, other than emotional support, said Dr. Tony Ogburn, who chairs the OB-GYN department at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine. But in other situations, he said, providers may need to intervene to stop bleeding and make sure no pregnancy tissue remains, as a guard against infection. Dr. Lauren Thaxton, an OB-GYN and assistant professor at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas-Austin, has already heard about local patients who have been miscarrying, and couldn't get a pharmacy to fill their misoprostol prescription. ""The pharmacy has said, 'We don't know whether or not you might be using this medication for the purposes of abortion,'"" she said. Thaxton, who supervises the obstetrics-gynecology residents who have seen these patients, said sometimes the prescribing clinic will intervene, but it takes the patient longer to get the medication. Other times patients don't report the problem and miscarry on their own, she said, but without medication they risk additional bleeding. Under another new Texas abortion law, someone who ""aids or abets"" an abortion after cardiac activity can be detected — typically around six weeks — can be subject to at least a $10,000 fine per occurrence. Anyone can bring that civil action, posing a quandary for physicians and other providers. How do they follow the latest guidelines when numerous other people — from other medical professionals to friends and family members — can question their intent: Are they helping care for a miscarriage or facilitating an abortion? Sometimes patients don't realize that they have lost the pregnancy until they come in for a checkup and no cardiac activity can be detected, said Dr. Emily Briggs, a family physician who delivers babies in New Braunfels, Texas. At that point, the patient can opt to wait until the bleeding starts and the pregnancy tissue is naturally released, Briggs said. For some, that's too difficult, given the emotions surrounding the pregnancy loss, she said. Instead, the patient may choose medication or a surgical evacuation procedure, which Briggs said may prove necessary anyway to avoid a patient becoming septic if some of the tissue remains in the uterus. But now in Texas, the new laws are creating uncertainties that may deter some doctors and other providers from offering optimal miscarriage treatment. These situations can create significant moral distress for patients and providers, said Bryn Esplin, a bioethicist and assistant professor of medical education at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth. ""Any law that creates a hesitancy for physicians to uphold the standard of care for a patient has a cascade of harmful effects both for the patient but also for everyone else,"" said Esplin. It's an emotional and legal dilemma that potentially faces not just obstetricians and midwives, but also family physicians, emergency physicians, pharmacists, and anyone else who might become involved with pregnancy care. And Ogburn, who noted that he was speaking personally and not for the medical school, worries that fears about the Texas laws have already delayed care. ""I wouldn't say this is true for our practice,"" he said. ""But I have certainly heard discussion among physicians that they're very hesitant to do any kind of intervention until they're absolutely certain that this is not possibly a viable pregnancy — even though the amount of bleeding would warrant intervening because it's a threat to the mother's life."" John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, described this type of hesitation as ""an awful misunderstanding of the law."" Even before the passage of the two bills, existing Texas law stated that the act is not an abortion if it involves the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy — which most commonly occurs when the pregnancy grows in the fallopian tube — or to ""remove a dead, unborn child whose death was caused by spontaneous abortion,"" he said, pointing to the statute. Another area of Texas law that Seago cited provides an exception to the state's abortion restrictions if the mother's life is in danger or she's at ""serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function"" unless an abortion is performed. ""It is a pro-life position to allow physicians to make those life-and-death decisions,"" Seago said. ""And that may mean in certain circumstances protecting the mother in this situation and the child passing away."" But interpretation of the laws is still causing challenges to care. At least several OB-GYNs in the Austin area received a letter from a pharmacy in late 2021 saying it would no longer fill the drug methotrexate in the case of ectopic pregnancy, citing the recent Texas laws, said Dr. Charlie Brown, an Austin-based obstetrician-gynecologist who provided a copy to KHN. Methotrexate also is listed in the Texas law passed last year. Ectopic pregnancy develops in an estimated 2% of reported pregnancies. Methotrexate or surgery are the only two options listed in the medical guidelines to prevent the fallopian tubes from rupturing and causing dangerous bleeding. ""Ectopic pregnancies can kill people,"" said Brown, a district chair for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing Texas. Tom Mayo, a professor of law at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law in Dallas, understands why some in Texas' pharmacy community might be nervous. ""The penalties are quite draconian,"" he said, noting that someone could be convicted of a felony. However, Mayo said that his reading of the law allows for the use of methotrexate to treat an ectopic pregnancy. In addition, he said, other Texas laws and the Roe v. Wade decision provide an exception to permit abortion if a pregnant person's life is in danger. Since the Texas laws include a stipulation that there must be intent to induce an abortion, Mayo said that he'd advise physicians and other clinicians to closely document the rationale for medical care, whether it's to treat a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. But Prager believes that the laws in Texas — and perhaps elsewhere soon — could boost physicians' vulnerability to medical malpractice lawsuits. Consider the patient whose miscarriage care is delayed and develops a serious infection and other complications, Prager said. ""And they decide to sue for malpractice,"" she said. ""They can absolutely do that."" Texas providers are still adjusting to other ripple effects that affect patient care. Dr. Jennifer Liedtke, a family physician in Sweetwater, Texas, who delivers about 175 babies annually, no longer sends misoprostol prescriptions to the local Walmart. Since the new laws took effect, Liedtke said, the pharmacist a handful of times declined to provide the medication, citing the new law — despite Liedtke writing the prescription to treat a miscarriage. Walmart officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Since pharmacists rotate through that Walmart, Liedtke decided to send those prescriptions to other pharmacies rather than attempt to sort out the misunderstanding anew each time. ""It's hard to form a relationship to say, 'Hey look, I'm not using this for an elective abortion,'"" she said. ""'I'm just using this because this is not a viable pregnancy.'""

WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed economist Lisa Cook on Tuesday to serve on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, making her the first Black woman to do so in the institution's 108-year history. Her approval was on a narrow, party-line vote of 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the decisive vote. Senate Republicans argued that she is unqualified for the position, saying she doesn't have sufficient experience with interest rate policy. They also said her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee suggested she wasn't sufficiently committed to fighting inflation, which is running at four-decade highs. Cook has a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and has been a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State since 2005. She was also a staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2012 and was an adviser to President Biden's transition team on the Fed and bank regulatory policy. Some of her most well-known research has focused on the impact of lynchings and racial violence on African American innovation. Cook is only the second of Biden's five nominees for the Fed to win Senate confirmation. His Fed choices have faced an unusual level of partisan opposition, given the Fed's history as an independent agency that seeks to remain above politics. Some critics charge, however, that the Fed has contributed to the increased scrutiny by addressing a broader range of issues in recent years, such as the role of climate change on financial stability and racial disparities in employment. Biden called on the Senate early Tuesday to approve his nominees as the Fed seeks to combat inflation. ""I will never interfere with the Fed,"" Biden said. ""The Fed should do its job and will do its job, I'm convinced."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell is currently serving in a temporary capacity after his term ended in February. He was approved by the Senate Banking Committee by a nearly unanimous vote in March. Fed governor Lael Brainard was confirmed two weeks ago for the Fed's influential vice chair position by a 52-43 vote. Philip Jefferson, a economics professor and dean at Davidson College in North Carolina, has also been nominated by Biden for a governor slot and was approved unanimously by the Finance Committee. He would be the fourth Black man to serve on the Fed's board. Biden has also nominated Michael Barr, a former Treasury Department official, to be Fed's top banking regulator, after a previous choice, Sarah Bloom Raskin, faced opposition from West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Cook, Jefferson, and Barr would join Brainard as Democratic appointees to the Fed.

There's a new king of Pittsburgh and his name is Louis Domingue. Domingue, the third-string goalie for the Pittsburgh Penguins, has become the unexpected star of the playoff series against the New York Rangers which Pittsburgh is currently up 3-1. The 30-year-old Canadian went into Game 1 of the series during the second overtime period and proceeded to make 17 saves as the game entered a third overtime period. The Penguins won 4-3 over the Rangers. Louis Domingue of the Pittsburgh Penguins during the first period in Game 3 of the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs on Saturday.

As if his performance wasn't enough, Domingue became even more of a new fan favorite when he revealed that in between the first and second overtime periods he had a non-traditional snack. ""I actually had quite the meal in between the first and second overtime,"" Domingue said in an interview. ""I didn't expect going in, but maybe it sustained my energy."" But what was the meal in question? ""Some spicy pork and broccoli – not the best,"" he added.

Domingue said the experience has made him feel like a rookie again. ""I'm a rookie at this – the playoffs,"" he said in a postgame interview.

I try to play this as it's just another game ... just another day,"" he said. ""At the end of the day we're playing hockey."" In some ways, Domingue has been playing these games for years. ""From the moment I brought my net outside in the street and put my rollerblades on and played outside and have cars go around my net, this is the film I was playing in my head the whole time,"" he said. ""I'm trying to control my emotions. It's pretty hard to be honest. It's so new and it's a lot. It's a lot, but we're going to take it a day at a time and move on ... to the next game.""

Banning Trump ""was a morally bad decision, to be clear, and foolish in the extreme,"" the billionaire said at a Financial Times conference on Tuesday. Twitter kicked Trump off after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The social network said Trump had broken its rules against inciting violence and that it decided to remove him ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence."" It was the first major platform to ban the then-president, a move quickly followed by Facebook and YouTube. ""I do think that it was not correct to ban Donald Trump,"" Musk said on Tuesday. ""I think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice,"" he added, pointing out that the former president has said he will start posting on his own social media app, Truth Social. (Trump has said he will not return to Twitter even if the ban is lifted.) Musk, who has said he wants to buy Twitter to encourage more free speech, said he thinks the platform should only ban accounts in rare cases to remove bots, spammers and scammers, ""where there's just no legitimacy to the account at all."" Otherwise, he said, permanent bans ""undermine trust."" He said Twitter co-founder and former chief executive Jack Dorsey shares his opinion that Twitter should not have permanent bans. Twitter has said Dorsey made the call to ban Trump last year, and the former CEO previously said it was ""the right decision."" Shortly after Musk's comments, Dorsey confirmed that he agrees. ""Generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don't work,"" he tweeted. Musk acknowledged that he does not yet own Twitter and so any plans to reinstate Trump's account are still theoretical. ""This is not like a thing that will definitely happen,"" he said. But his comments answer a question that has been hanging over the company since Musk made his surprise offer to buy it last month, saying he wanted to ""unlock"" its potential by loosening what he sees as unfair restrictions on free speech. Musk has given few details on how he would overhaul Twitter beyond saying he believes it should be a town square where everyone can be heard, and that the company should only restrict speech when required by law. Reinstating Trump, who was one of Twitter's most divisive and successful users, would add fuel to a heated discourse over the role of social networks in fostering open debate while not allowing their platforms to be abused by the loudest voices. ""What Musk proposes to do with the platform would represent a severe backslide in favor of allowing hate and misinformation that would put our communities in even more danger,"" said Sumayyah Waheed of the civil rights group Muslim Advocates. The group is a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council, which advises the company on its policies and products. ""Trump used that platform to encourage obviously false conspiracies about the election, all to undermine democracy and ensure that he could remain in office,"" Waheed said. ""As part of that effort, he encouraged a violent mob to storm the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in multiple deaths. During and after the insurrection, he used his Twitter account to downplay the insurrectionists' actions."" She continued: ""If this does not merit being banned from the platform, then I'm terrified of what else would be allowed under Musk's watch."" Allowing Trump to return could also exacerbate concerns among some Twitter employees who worry that Musk will undo years of work to curb abuse and harassment. Since Musk first revealed he had become Twitter's largest individual shareholder in early April, he has been publicly critical of the company and its employees. He continued to lob criticism even after reaching an agreement to buy the company for $44 billion, and has amplified attacks on Twitter's top lawyer and head of policy. ""Twitter needs to be much more even-handed. It currently has a strong left bias because it's based in San Francisco,"" Musk said on Tuesday. Conservatives have long accused tech companies of bias and censorship, even though there is no evidence for these allegations.",True,0.606294624,,

Redistricting eliminated one of the state's congressional districts, putting the two incumbents together in the 2nd District.

Trump backed Mooney, who criticized McKinley's vote for the infrastructure bill and for supporting the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection.

Former Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said President Donald Trump inquired about shooting protesters amid the unrest that took place after George Floyd's murder in 2020. He recounts that incident, and many others, in a wide-ranging interview with NPR's Michel Martin on All Things Considered. Esper said he stayed in the administration because he worried that if he left, the president would more easily implement some of his ""dangerous ideas."" The former Defense chief also said he hopes Trump does not seek the presidency in 2024. ""We need leaders of integrity and character, and we need leaders who will bring people together and reach across the aisle and do what's best for the country. And Donald Trump doesn't meet the mark for me on any of those issues."" Esper said he and other top officials were caught off guard by Trump's reaction to the unrest in the summer of 2020. ""The president was enraged,"" Esper recalled. ""He thought that the protests made the country look weak, made us look weak and 'us' meant him. And he wanted to do something about it. ""We reached that point in the conversation where he looked frankly at [Joint Chiefs of Staff] Gen. [Mark] Milley and said, 'Can't you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?' ... It was a suggestion and a formal question. And we were just all taken aback at that moment as this issue just hung very heavily in the air."" As a young Army captain in the mid-1990s, Esper said he saw the office occupied by the Defense secretary as hallowed ground, a place he hardly dared imagine himself. Yet, there he was 21 years later, serving as President Trump's secretary of Defense; facing challenges he also never imagined. He wrote about those challenges in a new book, A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times. In it, Esper describes Trump as a volatile, ill-informed leader obsessed with power and self image. Esper also detailed in his book a campaign by the former president and his then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to deny a promotion to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, whose congressional testimony led to Trump's first impeachment. Vindman, a Ukraine expert and former official with the National Security Council, testified that he was present during a now-infamous phone call between the former president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump tried to blackmail Zelenskyy for political dirt on Joe Biden and his family. That allegation helped ignite the impeachment effort against Trump. Esper said he worries about the fallout from Trump's political tactics. ""It became much more than Alexander Vindman at that point when you have this behavior going on. It became a test of, were we going to allow political influence in our promotion systems and in how we assign people? And that's a hard red line for me and others in the Pentagon that we weren't going to allow that to happen, let let alone a vendetta against a single individual who was doing the right thing."" This interview has been edited and condensed. When asked whether he thinks a prolonged conflict in Ukraine could weaken the NATO alliance: I think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is more committed to what he's doing in Ukraine than I'm afraid we [NATO nations] may be in the long run to standing up to Putin, and maybe he's calculating on that. But I also believe that the Ukrainians are far more committed to defending their country than Putin estimated. It's a major miscalculation, and one we should understand in the context of the fact that he invaded Georgia in 2008 and he invaded Ukraine in 2014. And in both cases, he really didn't get a stiff response from the West. It's not just Russia we have to worry about. Keep in mind that China is watching, too, and they are gauging Western resolve. On whether the U.S. should be doing more to support Ukraine: I said this [on] Day One of the invasion: We should be putting every possible sanction we can on the Russians. We should be providing the Ukrainians with all the equipment they're asking for. But we have to also continue unifying our Western allies. We now have two countries — Sweden and Finland — who are seeking NATO's membership or who we expect will seek NATO membership. That will strengthen NATO. And I think we should bring them in quickly and bring the umbrella of Article five protection under them equally as quickly. On why he decided to stay in the Trump administration, despite wanting to leave: I wrestled with this a lot. And at the end of the day, [it] came down to two things: If I left, I was very concerned about what would happen and would some of these dangerous ideas be implemented? And secondly, if I left, who would be who would replace me? And I was fairly confident that the president would replace me with an uber loyalist, who would do exactly what he wanted. And so I thought the right thing to do, the greater good my duty was to stay and serve the country. On how he responds to critics who say he saved troubling, behind-the-scenes details of the Trump administration for a book deal: I would say that I saw these things happen and did something. I stayed in the fight, in the game, and managed to avoid bad things happening. If you read the book, you'll see any number of cases where I was able to steer off or push back bad things from happening that I am convinced that if I had left, if I had resigned on the spot in protest – which by the way, would have been a whole lot better for me personally – I truly believe that these bad things would have happened. And my bottom line was I could do more good for the country, for the American people, if I stayed rather than if I walked away, particularly since I was so confident that President Trump would put in an uber loyalist who would do exactly what he wanted to do.""

Keeping track of vaccine side effects, the results from Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has highlighted seven of the most common side effects of the Pfizer jab. These are: pain at the injection site; fatigue; headache; myalgia – in other words, muscle pain; chills; fever; and arthralgia - i.e. joint paints. Each of these side effects were reported in more than one in 10 people involved in the trial. These set of weekly results lag behind real-time figures, with the report covering the period from December 9 to February 21. The report added that the reactions to the vaccines could be moderate in intensity, but resolved within a few days after vaccination. Adverse reactions were less frequent in older adults, aged 55 and older – predominately affecting younger people instead.

The MHRA stated it's committed to continually monitor safety during widespread use of a vaccine. ""Vaccination is the single most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from COVID-19,"" said the MHRA. The number of coronavirus vaccinations in the UK is now nearing 21 million. There has been 963,862 people who have now received their second dose of the vaccine, as of March 4. As for the daily number of people testing positive for the virus, this stands at 6,573 people for the same time period. The estimated ""R"" number – the reproduction rate – has remained between 0.6 to 0.9 across the UK, suggesting the size of the pandemic is shrinking. Schools are set to return on Monday, March 8, and lots of people will be keeping their eyes on the figures. As it stands, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out a roadmap out of lockdown. This is contingent on the pandemic not putting extreme pressure on the overworked NHS. For now, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus, and those dying from the disease has been decreasing. This downward trend has also been seen in the number of patients admitted to hospital, so let's hope it stays that way.",False,0.929334564,,

If you've just tested positive for COVID-19, and you have common risk factors for serious illness, there are now ample treatments available – generally at little or no cost – that could help you avoid the worst and recover more quickly from a mild or moderate case of COVID. Paxlovid, a five-day course of pills from Pfizer, is at the top of the list of recommended treatments. Studies from the drugmaker showed that – in unvaccinated people at risk of serious COVID medical risk factors – Paxlovid was nearly 90% effective at cutting the risks of getting hospitalized or dying because of COVID. People who are vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID could still benefit from the drug, says Dr. Priya Nori, an infectious disease physician at Montefiore Health System in Bronx, New York, and a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Taking Paxlovid could ""help you get back on your feet faster, feel better faster, and be potentially less infectious faster,"" Nori says. The Biden administration has been talking up the treatment. ""We want all individuals to know about this effective medication, and to have a conversation with their health care provider about if they are eligible, and whether they should be making a plan"" for accessing the drug if they do test positive, says Dr. Meg Sullivan, chief medical officer for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the Department of Health and Human Services. But some people have had trouble getting the medicine quickly, when it can make a difference in the progression of the disease, despite the administration's effort to make the medicines easy to obtain after a positive test for COVID-19. Dan Weissman, 54, tried three different routes to access Paxlovid in the Chicago area when he got COVID in April. First, the nearby CVS Minute Clinic didn't have any appointments readily available. Then, the nurse practitioner at the urgent care clinic he went to initially misunderstood his medical conditions and refused to prescribe the pills. Eventually, his wife tracked down his recently retired primary care doctor, who wrote him a prescription. Weissman is glad he got the pills; his condition improved after taking them. But he says it took ""an unusual amount of knowledge, connections and assertiveness,"" to obtain them. Luckily, Weissman, host of the health podcast An Arm and A Leg, had all three. In upstate New York, after a few days of COVID symptoms, Pamela Coukos' college-age son tested positive on a recent Friday. ""He has one of the risk factors; he seemed pretty sick. And also, it would be better if he didn't spend, like, 10 days feeling terrible because he was in the middle of final exams,"" Coukos says. But the university health service was closing, and the nearest ""test to treat"" location wasn't open on weekends. He managed to book a Saturday telehealth appointment with his primary care doctor in his home state of Maryland, who sent a prescription to a pharmacy in upstate New York. A friend drove 26 miles each way to pick it up. The sick student took the pills, recovered by Wednesday and went on to complete his exams. ""It was ultimately successful, but more complicated than it needed to be,"" Coukos says. COVID pills are authorized by FDA for people at high risk of disease progression – and in practice, the risk criteria have broadened as supply has increased, says Dr. Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at University of California, San Francisco, who serves on the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel. During the winter omicron surge, pill supplies were limited, and many health care providers prescribed Paxlovid only to those who were most vulnerable, due to older age or serious underlying illnesses. Now, health conditions such as high cholesterol, depression, smoking-related lung disease, obesity, not being fully vaccinated or boosted – all factors that increase a person's risk for severe COVID outcomes – might qualify a recently infected COVID patient for a course of Paxlovid. ""If someone wants it, and is eligible for it, they should be able to access it,"" Tien says. The antiviral pills require a prescription, and need to be started within five days of symptoms appearing. To get a prescription you'll have to show positive COVID-19 test results, and review your risk factors and any medications you take with a health care provider. Paxlovid – a combination of two antiviral drugs called nirmatrelvir and ritonavir – can't be taken at the same time as some common supplements and medications, including statins and some birth control pills. ""There's a long list of drug-drug interactions,"" says Jacinda Abdul-Mutakabbir, an assistant professor at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy, ""You want to make sure you bring forth any other medications you may be taking"" for medical evaluation before you receive the medication. The drug could also be dangerous for those with reduced kidney or liver function. For those who can't take Paxlovid, there are several other early COVID-19 treatments that a health care provider might prescribe, such as remdesivir or monoclonal antibody infusions. Molnupiravir, a five-day pill treatment from Merck, is another option, although it is prescribed far less often than Paxlovid. In a clinical trial the Merck drug reduced hospitalization by only 30%. Common side effects of taking Paxlovid include a metallic taste, diarrhea, increased blood pressure and muscle aches – all temporary. ""While these side effects are not ideal, they're definitely better than what we would see if these individuals were to go forth and develop severe COVID,"" says Abdul-Mutakabbir. Here are three ways to access COVID pills, if you're eligible to get them. For those with health insurance and access to their primary care providers or health care team, you can make an in-person or telehealth appointment to get tested (or share your positive test results), assessed for risks and medications and, if eligible, obtain a prescription for the pills. You'd then get the prescription filled at a nearby pharmacy. Having a provider that knows your medical history, as well as the details of your current situation, can be very helpful, says Dr. Ulrika Wigert, a family medicine physician at CentraCare in Sauk Center, Minnesota. ""Did you test the first day [of symptoms]? Did you test the second day? How sick were you when you tested?"" And, if you're starting to feel better by the time you get the medication, do the benefits of taking the medication outweigh any risks? ""Having a provider help navigate that on the individual patient basis"" can help guide you through an appropriate course of care, she says. Another route to getting Paxlovid is visiting one of the 2,300 health centers, urgent care clinics and pharmacies that are designated by the government as ""test to treat"" sites. These are locations that have on-site prescribing capabilities and pills on-hand. ""For individuals who do not have a health care provider, or are unable to access their health care provider within a short time frame...test-to-treat locations offer testing and evaluation with a health care provider to determine if that medication is appropriate, and can dispense the medication on-site,"" says Sullivan of HHS. Test-to-treat locations can be found on this map. Before you go, ""check with your health plan to make sure that they are in-network with your plan,"" says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, ""So theservices you receive there will be fully covered, or at least you'll be subject only to a nominal copayment."" For those without insurance, some of the test-to-treat sites are federally qualified health centers that can provide low cost COVID testing and treatment services to the uninsured. For those who prefer telehealth visits – and may not be able to get an appointment quickly through their primary health care provider – virtual healthcare platforms such as Plushcare, eMed and Truepill offer online visits to test, assess and prescribe COVID medications. The appointments are available at all hours, and may come with some out-of-pocket costs. A prescription can be sent to a nearby pharmacy, or filled and shipped to you, depending on what the service offers. ""The pro of this approach is that it's designed just for this purpose – of testing and treating for COVID,"" says Montefiore's Nori. ""You'll efficiently get the service you need."" The cons, she says, are that they don't know your full situation, such as your home context and your medical history. ""They're relying on you to convey all your medications, herbal remedies,"" she says, but it can provide you with timely access to treatment. If you're concerned about getting COVID and want to make a plan of action ahead of time, experts recommend four steps: And, stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations, to help protect yourself and those around you from getting infected. Now, a caveat on costs: although the pills themselves are free, there may be some out-of-pocket fees. Testing, getting a health care consultation and prescription, and follow up can cost you, depending on whether you're insured and what your insurance covers, says Georgetown's Corlette. To lower costs, those with health insurance should seek care in-network when possible; for those without insurance, a federally qualified health center may provide services that are free or very low cost, she says.",False,0.835565293,,

At 91, Daniel Ellsberg is certain of many things. One of them is that unofficial leaks of government documents are fundamental to keeping a check on the most powerful operators of our society. ""Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeline of a republic,"" he told NPR during a phone interview from his home in Northern California. And anyone who chooses to take on the burden of sharing such information in the public interest, ""is doing this republic a very great service and helping it to remain a republic."" He was the person who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times (until they were blocked by the courts from publishing the documents) then sneaked them to The Washington Post. The study – officially called the Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force – chronicled decades of failed U.S. policy in Vietnam, and laid bare the ways in which the public was misled in how the war was conducted. Ellsberg was a national security analyst at the time and gained access to the classified documents using his top secret clearances. When he was eventually discovered, he was arrested and became the first person in the United States to be prosecuted under the Espionage Act. ""They tried to put me in [prison] for 150 years,"" he recalled, laughing. The charges, however, didn't stick after investigators discovered Nixon administration officials had tapped Ellsberg's phone and broken into his psychiatrist's office to obtain information that would discredit him.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images hide caption Daniel Ellsberg, pictured speaking at a news conference, leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times and The Washington Post. He was eventually arrested and became the first person in the United States to be prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Now, watching the fallout of the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that suggests overturning Roe v. Wade, Ellsberg acknowledges the extraordinary nature of the recent breach, which seems to have ruptured the trust between the highest court and the public. ""It's obvious why they want to keep it secret, "" he said. ""No organization really wants to show how the sausage is made or legislation is made, and they prefer to be the only voice on policy to the public."" Fifty years after the Pentagon Papers leak, Americans have been made privy to the internal, secretive discussions of the Supreme Court, exposing the role that politics plays in the justices' rulings. ""The Supreme Court wants to get all the authority it can from hiding the nature of dissension; the details of arguments that people have made one way or the other,"" Ellsberg explained. But this particular decision is so consequential for the public that it is important they know what is really driving the majority's decision, he added. That's why, he said, ""It's a very good thing that it got out. It was important to be out."" If he was in the leaker's position, Ellsberg said he'd do the same thing. Ellsberg empathizes with Chief Justice John Roberts, who called the release of the opinion ""an affront"" and ""egregious,"" launching an investigation into the source of the leak. ""But really,"" Ellsberg said, ""the politicization of the court is no secret at this point and for Justice Roberts to pretend there were no Democratic justices and Republican justices, that's really absurd. That notion has been demolished."" He also notes, as many others have, that after Politico published the draft, that the opinion is not a classified or secret document, meaning that no law has been broken. ""Strictly speaking, the law under which I was prosecuted, the Espionage Act, has never been confirmed by the Supreme Court to be constitutional, as applied to unauthorized disclosure to the American public, telling the truth to the public."" Roy Gutterman, a communications law professor and director of the center for free speech at Syracuse University, agrees that neither Politico or the leaker will likely face criminal charges. As of now, there is no law prohibiting such a public outing from within the Supreme Court, only centuries of decorum and unwritten internal standards. Additionally, when considering legality of the publication of the Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers under the First Amendment, the Supreme Court prepared to rule that the government could not block a publication from publishing the documents. Gutterman notes there are fewer protections for leakers, meaning there could be more potential liability for such actors. But he said, in this case ""it doesn't appear that there's a clear violation of a specific law."" He added: ""When you look at leak investigations they tend to focus on National Security issues and the leaking of a draft opinion is not a matter of National Security."" That is not to say there won't be consequences for the source. Given how few people had access to the draft opinion – by most estimates that figure stands at approximately 50 people, including the nine justices – it's more likely than not that they will not remain anonymous, Gutterman said. However, the long-term effects go much deeper than the potential repercussions on one person's career, according to Gutterman. ""It's an opening for future leaks on hot-button issues ... it's a slippery slope."" ""This could happen again and again, which would certainly undermine the independence of the court. And it would certainly stifle some degree of even collegiality and consensus-building among these justices,"" he said.",True,0.532961159,,

Local police believe that a man in Trenton, S.C., died of a heart attack while attempting to bury the body of a woman he killed. Investigators in South Carolina have made a breakthrough in an unusual homicide case involving a man who they believe killed a woman in his backyard — then suffered a heart attack and died as he attempted to bury her. Local sheriff's deputies and paramedics say they were initially called to the house in Trenton, S.C., after receiving a report of an unresponsive man lying in his yard. When they arrived at the scene, they found the collapsed body of Joseph McKinnon, 60. Also nearby: the body of Patricia Ruth Dent, 65, wrapped in trash bags, lying in a freshly dug pit. While investigators believed McKinnon may have died of natural causes, they immediately suspected foul play in Dent's death. That scenario was confirmed this week by the coroner, whose autopsy report found that McKinnon had suffered a cardiac arrest and Dent had been strangled. The pair had been living together at the address in a rural area of Trenton, the sheriff's office said. ""Evidence gathered at the scene, along with statements from witnesses aided investigators to build a timeline, leading us to believe that Mr. McKinnon attacked Ms. Dent while inside their home,"" Sheriff Jody Rowland and Coroner David Burnett of Edgefield County said in a joint statement sent to NPR. ""Mr. McKinnon then bound her and wrapped her in trash bags before putting her in the previously dug pit,"" the statement said. ""The pit was then partially filled in by Mr. McKinnon. While covering the pit, Mr. McKinnon had the cardiac event, causing his death."" Dent's twin sister, Pamela Briggs, told local TV station WRDW that she was shocked by her sister's death. ""Everybody who ever met her liked her. She was just full of energy. She was 65 and working,"" she said. Dent worked at the nearby Mount Vintage Golf Club, according to the incident report. Her body wasn't immediately discovered when first responders were called about McKinnon. Deputies began looking for Dent after a deputy coroner found her wallet at her home on Saturday. At the time, they were starting the process of investigating and notifying loved ones of McKinnon's death. But then the golf course confirmed that Dent hadn't come to work or called in on Saturday, prompting investigators to take a closer look at the large hole dug in the garden area of the yard, where Dent's body was found.",False,0.675460041,,

Just after noon on Tuesday, the air traffic control tower at Florida's Treasure Coast airport in Fort Pierce got an unusual call. ""I've got a serious situation here. My pilot has gone incoherent. And I have no idea how to fly the airplane,"" said the man, according to recordings of the air traffic control call. Thirty frantic minutes later — with the help of multiple air traffic controllers around West Palm Beach, Fla. — the plane and its passengers were safely on the ground in a remarkable and unusual emergency landing. The passenger who made the landing has not been publicly identified. In the recordings, he says several times that he does not know how to operate the Cessna Caravan aircraft, although his conversations with controllers indicate some familiarity with technical aviation terms. ""Luckily the passenger flying has been around aviation a little bit. But he wasn't a pilot and didn't really have any flying experience,"" said Robert Morgan, the Palm Beach International air traffic controller who helped him land the single-engine turboprop, in an interview with local TV station CBS 12. The plane departed from the Bahamas just before 11 a.m. for what should have been a short and uneventful flight to Treasure Coast. But with about 70 miles to go, flight logs show the plane beginning to deviate from its steady altitude and speed. Then, the plane takes a hard left turn, flying south parallel to the Florida coast, gently lifting back above 9,000 feet. The first call to air traffic control came afterward. Asked what his location was, the passenger responded: ""I have no idea. I see the coast of Florida in front of me, and I have no idea."" ""Try to hold the wings level and see if you can start descending for me. Push forward on the controls and descend at a very slow rate,"" the controller said. ""Just try to follow the coast either north- or southbound. We're trying to locate you."" As the plane headed toward the coast near Boca Raton, air traffic control at Palm Beach cleared the runways. And Morgan – who also has experience as a flight instructor – was called in from his break to help the passenger land safely, he said. He had never flown the Cessna, but used a picture of the cockpit to help coach the passenger through the landing. ""Before I knew it, he said, 'I'm on the ground, how do I turn this thing off?'"" Morgan said, speaking to WPBF, another local station. ""He told me that he couldn't wait to get home and hug his pregnant wife."" The plane landed just after 12:30 p.m. local time.

RUTLAND, Vt. — A 28-year-old man who was rescued from a raft off the coast of New England in 2016 after his boat sank pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges he killed his mother at sea to inherit the family's estate. Nathan Carman was arraigned in federal court in Rutland on multiple fraud charges and a first-degree murder charge in the death of Linda Carman. He shouted ""not guilty"" in the direction of reporters who had asked him on his way into the courthouse whether he killed his mother. Authorities allege in the indictment unsealed Tuesday that Carman also killed his grandfather, John Chakalos, at his home in Windsor, Connecticut, in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather's estate, but he was not charged with that killing. ""As a central part of the scheme, Nathan Carman murdered John Chakalos and Linda Carman,"" the indictment reads. Carman was found in an inflatable raft eight days after leaving a Rhode Island marina to go fishing with his mother, who was never found. Prosecutors allege Carman altered the boat to make it more likely to sink that day. He has denied doing anything to intentionally make the boat unseaworthy. Carman, who was arrested Tuesday, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Linda Carman, his mother. His attorney did not comment after the arraignment. Federal prosecutors said in a court document filed Wednesday he should remain detained because he poses a flight risk and is a danger to the community. They wrote that Carman was treated for mental health issues from when he was a small child until he was 17 years old and has avoided any treatment since then. ""For an individual who would kill his own family members, nothing is off the table,"" prosecutors wrote. A hearing is scheduled for Monday. Prosecutors allege the inheritance scheme that has spanned nearly a decade began with Carman buying a rifle in New Hampshire that he used to shoot Chakalos on Dec. 20, 2013, while he slept. He then discarded his computer hard drive and the GPS unit that had been in his truck, prosecutors said. Police have said Carman was the last person to see his grandfather alive and owned a semi-automatic rifle similar to the one used to kill Chakalos — but the firearm disappeared. After Chakalos' death, Carman received $550,000 from two bank accounts that his grandfather had set up and that he was the beneficiary of when Chakalos died. He moved from an apartment in Bloomfield, Connecticut, to Vernon, Vermont, in 2014. He was unemployed much of the time and by the fall of 2016, was low on funds, prosecutors said. In September 2016, Carman arranged to go on a fishing trip with his mother on his boat named the ""Chicken Pox."" ""Nathan Carman planned to kill his mother on the trip,"" the indictment reads. ""He also planned how he would report the sinking of the 'Chicken Pox' and his mother's disappearance at sea as accidents."" Before the trip, Carman altered the boat by removing two forward bulkheads and trim tabs from the transom of the hull, the indictment states. ""After leaving the marina, Nathan Carman killed his mother, Linda Carman, and eventually sank the Chicken Pox,"" it states. In 2019, a federal judge in Rhode Island decided that Carman contributed to the sinking of the boat. U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a written decision in favor of an insurance company that had refused to pay an $85,000 claim to Carman for the loss of his 31-foot fishing boat. Carmen denied the allegations, telling the Coast Guard that when the boat filled quickly with water, he swam to the life raft and called for his mother but never saw her again. He was found floating in the raft off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, a Massachusetts island, by the crew of a freighter eight days after the boat was reported missing. Chakalos, who was a real estate developer, left behind an estate that was worth nearly $29 million, which was to be divided among his four daughters. Carman is in line to get about $7 million of the estate, as his mother's only heir. Chakalos' three surviving daughters sued Carman in New Hampshire probate court, seeking to bar him from receiving any money from Chakalos' estate.

A nearly $1 billion tentative settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by families of victims and survivors of last June's condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida, an attorney said Wednesday. Harley S. Tropin announced the $997 million settlement during a hearing before Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Michael Hanzman. Still pending final approval, the settlement involves insurance companies, developers of an adjacent building and other defendants. ""I'm shocked by this result — I think it's fantastic,"" Hanzman said. ""This is a recovery that is far in excess of what I had anticipated."" Earlier this year, Hanzman had approved an $83 million settlement to compensate people who suffered economic losses such as condominium units and personal property. A key question from the beginning has been how to allocate money from the property's sale, insurance proceeds and damages from lawsuits among wrongful death cases and property claims. The 12-story Champlain Towers South condiminium collapsed abruptly in the early-morning hours of June 24, almost instantly destroying dozens of individual condo units and burying victims under tons of rubble. Rescuers spent weeks carefully digging through mountains of concrete, first to find survivors and later to recover the remains of those who died. A total of 98 people were killed. The main lawsuit, filed on behalf of Champlain Towers South victims and family members, contends that work on the adjacent Eighty Seven Park tower damaged and destabilized the Champlain Towers building, which was in dire need of major structural repair. Champlain Towers was in the midst of its 40-year structural review when it partially crumbled to the ground. Video released by a team of federal investigators showed evidence of extensive corrosion and overcrowded concrete reinforcement in the building. The collapse triggered lawsuits from victims, families and condo owners, and prompted state and federal investigations. In December, a Florida grand jury issued a lengthy list of recommendations aimed at preventing another condominium collapse, including earlier and more frequent inspections and better waterproofing. And in February of this year, the Florida House unanimously passed a bill that would require statewide recertification of any condo building above three stories high. The bill would require recertification after 30 years, or 25 years if the building is within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of the coast, and every 10 years thereafter. At the time of the collapse, Miami-Dade and Broward were the only two of the state's 67 counties that had condominium recertification programs. Champlain Towers was located in Surfside, a town just north of Miami Beach. The little-known enclave comprises a mix of older homes and condos similar to the collapsed tower, built decades ago for the middle-class, and recently erected luxury condos drawing the wealthy. That includes former first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who live about a block north of the collapsed condo.",True,0.580520062,,

Ramana. | Photo Credit: PTI Nobody should cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ and the court should respect the government and the legislature just as the government respects the court, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju said on Wednesday after the Supreme Court stayed the sedition law, while the Opposition parties welcomed the order. Several parties including the Congress, the CPI and the CPI(M) urged the Supreme Court to quash the sedition law without waiting for the government to complete its exercise of reviewing the law. Speaking to reporters after the order, Mr. Rijiju said: “We respect each other. The court should respect the government, legislature. The government should also respect the court. We have clear demarcation of boundary and that Lakshman Rekha should not be crossed by anybody.” The top court’s decision also led to a sparring between the former Congress chief, Rahul Gandhi, and Mr. Rijiju, who questioned the Congress’s record. “Speaking truth is patriotism, not treason. Telling the truth is loving the country, not being a traitor. Listening to the truth is Rajdharma. To crush the truth is arrogance of power,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. In response, Mr. Rijiju said these were empty words and that the Congress had been the “anti-thesis of freedom, democracy and respect for institutions”. “This party has always stood with Breaking India forces and left no opportunity to divide India,” tweeted the Law Minister, adding, “During the Anna Movement and the other anti-corruption movements too, those who were not toeing the UPA line were subjected to bullying, harassment, intimidation and arrests. All this under the watchful eyes of the UPA!” Responding to the Law Minister’s ‘Lakshman Rekha’ comment, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury pointed to the Constitutional scheme of division of powers that made the executive accountable to legislature, which, in turn, was answerable to the people. “Before talking about the Lakshman Rekha, the BJP should also remember its own actions in devaluing Parliament. By doing so, they seek to escape from accountability,” Mr. Yechury said, while pointing out that under the Modi government, 326 people had been arrested under the sedition law but only six convicted. “This is gross abuse of the law that has been taking place under the Modi government. This law should be scrapped and removed from the statute books...The Supreme Court must not wait for this government’s review and proceed to scrap the anachronistic Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code, when it resumes hearing in July 2022,” the CPI(M) leader added. CPI general secretary D. Raja called it a vindication of his long-held position and tweeted: “In 2011 itself, I moved a Private Member’s Bill in the Rajya Sabha for abolishing Section 124A. Nation and the Government are not the same thing. Criticism is what makes democracy healthy. Sedition must go!” Trinamool Congress leader and Lok Sabha member, Mahua Moitra, who was one of the petitioners in the case, tweeted, “Victory! Supreme Court stays Sec 124A- no new cases can be filed, existing cases can apply for bail & release immediately”. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Manoj Jha said the Centre had blurred the line between criticising the government and State by filing sedition cases against critics of the government. Lok Sabha member from the Bahujan Samaj Party, Danish Ali, said: “Hundreds of innocent people are in jail under Section 124A and both Central and State governments used the law to target political rivals”. “Whosoever tries to raise voice against the BJP government, the BJP brings false cases to suppress such persons.

Perarivalan. File | Photo Credit: The Hindu A claim by the Centre that the President, and not the Tamil Nadu Governor, has ""exclusive power"" to decide Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict A.G. Perarivalan's plea for pardon drew flak from the Supreme Court on Wednesday before it reserved the case for judgment. A three-judge Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao said the government's argument, if taken on face value, would leave Article 161 (the constitutional power of Governors of States to grant pardon) a ""dead-letter"". ""So, according to you, the power to grant pardon is exclusively that of the President... Well, in that case, pardons granted by Governors throughout the history of this nation across States are all null and void?"" Justice B.R. Gavai quizzed Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj, appearing for the Centre. The court said then by the Centre's logic every murder case convict would have to move the President for pardon. ""The end result of your submissions is that all pardons granted for IPC offences by Governors all these years are unconstitutional... If we try to accept your submissions, it would mean the President would have the exclusive power to grant pardons... So, over the period of 70-75 years, all pardons granted under Article 161 by Governors for IPC are unconstitutional!"" Justice Rao exclaimed at the nature of the Centre's submissions. The court was hearing the Centre's defence of the Tamil Nadu Governor's conduct of sitting for years together without acting on the advice of the State government to pardon and release Perarivalan, and topping it off by referring the file to the President without taking a decision. ""Please enlighten us about the constitutional provision which enables the Governor to refer a pardon plea filed under Article 161 to the President?"" Justices Rao and Gavai, accompanied by Justice A.S. Bopanna on the Bench, asked the Centre. Mr. Natraj replied that the Tamil Nadu government had tried to ""usurp"" the power of the President and the Centre to decide on the question of pardon. ""The power was conferred on us [the Centre] to advice the President on the question of pardon,"" Mr. Natraj replied defensively. ""By that analogy, if a pardon is sought in a murder case, the Governor should refer it to the President?"" Justice Gavai asked. Perarivalan was sentenced to life sentence for murder. Terrorism charges were earlier withdrawn. Justice Rao intervened, asking why the Centre was representing the Governor in the case. ""What is your locus standi to represent the Governor?"" the judge queried. Mr. Natraj reasoned that the Governor was a constitutional office. ""And when the system is not functioning as per the constitutional mandate, anybody can bring it to the notice of the court,"" the lawyer argued. ""The Governor is the head of the State. He represents the State concerned. If at all somebody has to speak for the Governor, it will be the State and not the Centre,"" Justice Rao responded. The court had, in the previous hearing, given two options in the case. One, to release Perarivalan who has suffered over 30 years in prison. The other, for the Centre to argue and have the case decided on merits. The Centre chose the latter. Perarivalan, represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate Prabu Ramasubramanian, had approached the apex court against the prolonged delay and lack of decision on the part of the Tamil Nadu Governor on his pardon plea.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who headed the two-judge Bench, struck down as unconstitutional the exception to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which says that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife aged 18 or above is not rape even if it is without her consent. However, Justice C. Hari Shankar rejected the plea to criminalise marital rape noting that any change in the law has to be carried out by the legislature since the issue requires consideration of various aspects, including social, cultural and legal. “The right to withdraw consent at any given point in time forms the core of the woman’s right to life and liberty which encompasses her right to protect her physical and mental being,” Justice Shakdher said, calling for a change in the 162-year-old law. “While marital rape leaves physical scars, it inflicts much deeper scars on the psyche of the victim which remain with her years after the offence has occurred,” the judge added. The two judges differed on key issues such as availability of evidence, the importance of consent, whether the court could adjudicate over the issue of marital rape or only the legislature could decide, whether the State's concerns about safeguarding the institution of marriage were valid or not, and whether remedies were available to women survivors of spousal violence in other laws such as the law on domestic violence. ""Consent is not the sole deciding factor. What determines whether or not the sexual act is an offence are the circumstances set forth in Section 375. In other words, circumstances/context determine the nature of consent or its absence,"" said Justice Shankar. Probing the issue of consent further, he said, ""consent is given as a part of spousal intimacy although the will to engage may be absent."" He also said that presence of injuries on a partner during sex may not necessarily imply absence of consent as ""in the age of sexual liberation"" injuries could be a sign of ""passion"". He was referring to sado masochistic sex. The judge further noted that by removing the exception, courts will be creating an offence, which is proscribed in law. ""Therefore, State's intervention through the legislative route is required to balance individual dignity and prevent the possibility of abuse of legal remedies which may end up harming an individual's dignity/reputation,"" according to Justice Shankar In India, marital rape is not defined in any statute or law. The High Court’s verdict came on a bunch of petitions, including by NGO RIT Foundation, the All India Democratic Women’s Association and a marital rape victim, who challenged the exception to Section 375 of the IPC. Justice Shakdher also relied on the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) which shows that sexual violence is most often committed by individuals with whom women have an intimate relationship. The 2019-21 NFHS report shows that among ever-married women aged 18-49 who have ever experienced sexual violence, 83% report their current husband and 13% report a former husband as perpetrators. Following the split verdict, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chairperson Swati Maliwal tweeted, ""Don't know how many more years we will have to wait to change a British era law! Marital rape is a reality and it's high time we take the strongest action against it!"". Senior advocate Colin Gonsalvez, who represented a woman in the case, said, “the marital rape verdict is disappointing. One judgment is 100% correct and the other judgment is 100% wrong. All across the world, marital rape has been criminalised”. Advocate J Sai Deepak, who represented the NGO, Men Welfare Trust (MWT), which opposed the petitions seeking criminalisation of marital rape, said he was happy that one of the judges on the Bench had agreed with his position. The NGO had argued that sexual intercourse between a husband and wife could not be treated at par with that in non-marital relationships as the issue of consent could not be divorced from the context of a marriage.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — A first-of-its-kind federal study of Native American boarding schools that for over a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children into white society has identified more than 400 such schools that were supported by the U.S. government and more than 50 associated burial sites, a figure that could grow exponentially as research continues. The report released Wednesday by the Interior Department expands the number of schools that were known to have operated for 150 years, starting in the early 19th century and coinciding with the removal of many tribes from their ancestral lands. The dark history of the boarding schools — where children who were taken from their families were prohibited from speaking their Native American languages and often abused — has been felt deeply across Indian Country and through generations. Many children never returned home. The investigation has so far turned up over 500 deaths at 19 schools, though the Interior Department said that number could climb to the thousands or even tens of thousands. ""Many of those children were buried in unmarked or poorly maintained burial sites far from their Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Villages, the Native Hawaiian Community, and families, often hundreds, or even thousands, of miles away,"" the report said. A second volume of the report will cover the burial sites as well as the federal government's financial investment in the schools and the impacts of the boarding schools on Indigenous communities, the Interior Department said. ""The consequences of federal Indian boarding school policies — including the intergenerational trauma caused by the family separation and cultural eradication inflicted upon generations of children as young as 4 years old — are heartbreaking and undeniable,"" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. Haaland, who is Laguna, announced an initiative last June to investigate the troubled legacy of boarding schools and uncover the truth about the government's role in them. The 408 schools her agency identified operated in 37 states or territories, many of them in Oklahoma, Arizona and New Mexico. The Interior Department acknowledged the number of schools identified could change as more data is gathered. The coronavirus pandemic and budget restrictions hindered some of the research over the last year, said Bryan Newland, the Interior Department's assistant secretary for Indian Affairs. The department has so far found at least 53 burial sites at or near the U.S. boarding schools, both marked and unmarked. The U.S. government directly ran some of the boarding schools. Catholic, Protestant and other churches operated others with federal funding, backed by U.S. laws and policies to ""civilize"" Native Americans. The Interior Department report was prompted by the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at former residential school sites in Canada that brought back painful memories for Indigenous communities. Haaland also announced Wednesday a yearlong tour for Interior Department officials that will allow former boarding school students from Native American tribes, Alaska Native villages and Native Hawaiian communities to share their stories as part of a permanent oral history collection. ""It is my priority to not only give voice to the survivors and descendants of federal Indian boarding school policies, but also to address the lasting legacies of these policies so Indigenous Peoples can continue to grow and heal,"" she said. Boarding school conditions varied across the U.S. and Canada. While some former students have reported positive experiences, children at the schools often were subjected to military-style discipline and had their long hair cut. Early curricula focused heavily on outdated vocational skills, including homemaking for girls. Tribal leaders have pressed the agency to ensure that any children's remains that are found are properly cared for and delivered back to their tribes, if desired. The burial sites' locations will not be released publicly to prevent them from being disturbed, Newland said. Accounting for the whereabouts of children who died has been difficult because records weren't always kept. Ground penetrating radar has been used in some places to search for remains. The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which created an early inventory of the schools, has said Interior's work will be an important step for the U.S. in reckoning with its role in the schools but noted that the agency's authority is limited. Later this week, a U.S. House subcommittee will hear testimony on a bill to create a truth and healing commission modeled after one in Canada. Several church groups are backing the legislation.",True,0.524321565,,

Mallory McMorrow was stunned when she saw it. With horror, the Michigan state senator, a Democrat, read an email accusing her of ""grooming"" children. The email was sent by a fellow senator, Republican Lana Theis, who was soliciting funds from her supporters for her reelection campaign. In that email, Theis wrote that children are ""under assault in our schools"" by what she called ""progressive mobs trying to steal our children's innocence."" ""She accused me by name of grooming and wanting to sexualize kindergartners,"" McMorrow tells NPR. ""I mean, my heart absolutely sank."" McMorrow says she kept thinking about her 1-year-old daughter, Noa. ""You know, grooming is the act of befriending a child for the purpose of molesting them,"" she says. ""Just the most horrific, disgusting, vile accusation that can be thrown at you."" Lately, that accusation has been thrown at those who support LGBTQ rights —teachers, companies, politicians — in addition to McMorrow: ""Grooming"" has become an incendiary buzzword of right-wing rhetoric, weaponized in the fight over anti-LGBTQ legislation. Actual grooming occurs when adults take advantage of a child's vulnerability to manipulate and coerce the child into sexual abuse. Now that meaning has been warped and corrupted to broadly smear the motives of LGBTQ people and those who oppose anti-LGBTQ legislation. The day after she read the email accusing her of ""groom[ing] and sexualiz[ing] kindergartners,"" McMorrow stood on the Michigan Senate floor and shot back in a fiery speech that has gone viral, with millions of views. Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow responds to accusations of ""grooming"" children in a speech on April 19. ""I am the biggest threat to your hollow, hateful scheme,"" she said in a direct address to Theis, her voice filled with outrage, ""because you can't claim that you are targeting marginalized kids in the name of — quote — 'parental rights' if another parent is standing up to say no."" In that speech, McMorrow made a point of saying, twice, ""I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom,"" and she concluded with this thought: ""I know that hate will only win if people like me stand by and let it happen."" Reflecting on that speech now, McMorrow hopes her words will counterbalance some of the hurtful rhetoric LGBTQ people are bombarded with. ""I talked to kids in my district at a high school last Monday,"" she says, ""and the first question was from a girl, probably 15 or 16, who said, 'You know, I identify as queer. I'm LGBTQ. Why do they hate us?' And it's just heartbreaking."" McMorrow said she told the student, ""I promise you, there are a lot of us like me who don't."" The ""grooming"" accusation hurled at McMorrow, among many others, has a long history. Accusing LGBTQ people of ""grooming"" or ""recruiting"" children to become gay or transgender is an age-old trope that feeds off fear. The ""grooming"" smear often expands to include accusations of pedophilia and sex trafficking — conspiracy theories spawned by far-right extremists such as QAnon supporters, propagated widely through social media and right-wing channels and spreading through mainstream conservative thought. ""It's a despicable attack, but it's not a new tactic,"" says LGBTQ rights activist Evan Wolfson. ""This is a classic trope of dehumanization and fear that has been used against gay people decade after decade after decade. ... Think about the calumny against gay people throughout most of our lifetimes: that gay people somehow are molesting kids, or after kids, or predatory."" That idea propelled anti-gay activist and singer Anita Bryant's Save Our Children campaign in the 1970s. And it led to a 1978 California ballot measure to ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools, an initiative spearheaded by state Sen. John Briggs, who promised, ""We are going to restore morality to the classroom and remove openly and blatant homosexuals from influencing and teaching our young."" But the homophobic attacks continued, fueling a moral panic. ""This is only Round 1,"" said California state Sen. John Briggs to the press about the defeat of Proposition 6 on Nov. 7, 1978. Proposition 6, called the Briggs Initiative, sought to ban gays and lesbians from working in California public schools. Doug Pizac/AP hide caption Wolfson heard those attacks all through the fight he led to legalize same-sex marriage. Now, he says, there's an added layer of transphobia. ""The trans conversation is relatively newer,"" Wolfson says, ""and therefore more susceptible to confusion, to distraction and to primal fear, which is what pushing the button about kids is intended to do."" Fears stoked about LGBTQ people have surfaced in focus groups and polling conducted by the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that researches public attitudes on LGBTQ issues. ""What the far right often does is they engage people's reptilian brains, the fight-or-flight instinct,"" says the organization's executive director, Ineke Mushovic. ""And so it behooves far-right conservatives to put people in a state of fear, because then they're reactive. They don't support change."" The ""grooming"" narrative, Mushovic says, ""taps into this primal sense of fear and this kind of parental protective instinct. But we know it's a completely false narrative."" The ""grooming"" narrative has been actively promoted by conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who has also led the charge against teaching critical race theory. Now he has turned his attention to what he calls ""gender ideology."" This year, he asked for help from his Twitter followers: ""I'm looking for documents, PDFs, audio-video, and training materials related to gender, grooming, and trans ideology in schools,"" he tweeted. 🚨 I want to do a series of reports on gender ideology in K-12 schools—and need your help.I'm looking for documents, PDFs, audio-video, and training materials related to gender, grooming, and trans ideology in schools.Send confidentially to chrisrufo@protonmail.com. 🚨 In a speech at Hillsdale College in April titled ""Laying Siege to the Institutions,"" Rufo explained his strategy for steering the narrative about gender and sexual identity. ""You have to be very aggressive,"" he told the audience. ""You have to fight on terms that you define. You have to create your own frame, your own language. And you have to be ruthless and brutal in pursuit of something good."" For Utah state Sen. Daniel Thatcher, this distortion of a term as loaded as ""grooming"" is appalling. ""This idea of grooming, I'll tell ya, to me — as a survivor of childhood sexual assault — I'll just tell ya, I find it personally deeply offensive,"" he says. ""So why do they do it? Well, they do it because it resonates so deeply."" Thatcher is a Republican. This year, he broke with his party, speaking out against a bill to ban transgender girls from competing in girls' school sports. Utah state Sen. Daniel Thatcher spoke out on March 25 against legislation banning transgender girls from competing on girls' sports teams in schools. But five years ago, he would have supported that bill, Thatcher says, ""because I didn't know. I had no frame of reference for people who literally feel like they have to justify their right to exist. But I get it now. And because I get it, I can't un-get it."" Thatcher says he ""gets it"" now because of his work with LGBTQ people on suicide prevention. His position on these issues resulted in an attack from a right-wing activist group in Utah that accused him in an email to its supporters of promoting ""grooming of children for gender non-conformity in our public schools."" Thatcher calls the explicit email ""the nastiest thing I've ever seen."" ""Grooming is an act that happens as you break down barriers of someone,"" he says. ""It's especially heinous when pointed at unsuspecting, trusting, vulnerable children. And so the argument that telling a child that you will support them regardless of who and how they love is somehow equivalent to teaching a child that they're not allowed to say no or set boundaries — like, to me, that is just reprehensible, to conflate the two."" Thatcher warns that his party's emphasis on passing anti-LGBTQ legislation, such as bans on gender-affirming care or trans sports bans, will backfire. ""The path that the GOP is on right now is not sustainable,"" he says. ""If somebody tried to campaign today on ending gay marriage, they would get so little traction outside the most fringe elements, and yet, even five years ago, that wasn't an extreme position. ... I think it's only a matter of time. I think this is a stupid, stupid argument to be making, because every day, more and more people know someone who is gay or transgender."" For his part, Alabama state Rep. Neil Rafferty, the only openly gay member of his state's legislature, remains optimistic, even in the face of Alabama passing some of the country's harshest anti-LGBTQ laws. ""People say, 'Well, Alabama's gonna Alabama,' "" Rafferty says. ""But I have no choice but to remain hopeful. Because if I don't have hope that it can get better, if I don't have hope that we can change it, if I don't have hope that we can push back, and push back effectively and meaningfully, then what the hell am I even doing here?"" The amped-up accusations of ""grooming"" have led to a disturbing spike in threats and assaults against LGBTQ people, according to Sarah Kate Ellis, head of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD. ""This does lead to real-world harm,"" Ellis says. ""It absolutely does. We're already seeing an uptick in violence against the community."" In response to the wave of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation, GLAAD has launched a media campaign, with a public service announcement airing nationwide that features the Briggle family of Texas. The LGBTQ rights group GLAAD created this public service announcement in support of transgender youth. It features the Briggle family of Texas. ""Do you want to meet a family with a transgender kid? Here we are,"" the mother, Amber Briggle, begins, as she introduces their transgender teenage son. He's shown doing backflips and playing his ukulele. ""My family's just like yours,"" Briggle says in the public service announcement. ""We love our kids unconditionally, and we will never stop fighting for them. Stand with us. Protect our families."" Individual stories like this one are crucial, says Wolfson, the LGBTQ rights activist, who crafted messages for the Freedom to Marry campaign that were designed to personalize and humanize same-sex couples. During the effort to legalize same-sex marriage, the Freedom to Marry campaign created videos like this one to build support and humanize the people who would benefit. ""When we showed gay people,"" he says, ""when we elevated the voices of gay people as part of the conversation — and I say this as someone who is gay — we wanted to show the gay people as part of a family, the gay people as part of a workplace, the gay people in this case as part of a classroom. And I think the same lesson applies here too."" The slogan ""Love Is Love"" was the lesson learned in the Freedom to Marry campaign. Now, Wolfson suggests the slogan ""Protect All Kids."" Or, from Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, this idea: ""Hate Won't Win.""",True,0.55844641,,

NEW YORK — A New York judge said Wednesday he will lift Donald Trump's contempt of court order if the former president meets conditions including paying $110,000 in fines he's racked up for being slow to respond to a civil subpoena issued by the state's attorney general. Judge Arthur Engoron said he will lift his finding of contempt if Trump submits additional paperwork by May 20 detailing efforts to search for the subpoenaed records and explaining his and his company's document retention policies. Engoron found Trump in contempt on April 25 and fined him $10,000 per day for not complying with New York Attorney General Letitia James' subpoena, issued as part of a long-running investigation into Trump's business practices. James, a Democrat, has said her three-year investigation has uncovered evidence that the former president's company misstated the value of assets like skyscrapers and golf courses on financial statements for over a decade. Trump has denied the allegations, calling James' investigation ""racist"" and a ""witch hunt."" James is Black. Trump's lawyers contend James is using her civil investigation to gain access to information that could then be used against the Republican former president in a parallel criminal investigation being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, also a Democrat. The legal battle between James and Trump was also playing out Wednesday before a midlevel state appeals court, which was hearing arguments in a related subpoena matter: Trump's appeal of the judge's Feb. 17 ruling requiring him to answer questions under oath in the investigation. Trump wants to avoid having to speak with the investigators. In a statement Wednesday, James praised Engoron's handling of the contempt allegation. ""For years, Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization have tried to thwart our lawful investigation, but today's decision makes clear that no one can evade accountability,"" James said in a statement. ""We will continue to enforce the law and seek answers as part of this investigation."" A message seeking comment was left with Trump's lawyer. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $110,000 because that is the total amount of fines he accrued through May 6, when Trump's lawyers submitted 66 pages of court documents detailing the efforts by him and his lawyers to locate the subpoenaed records. The judge required that a company Trump hired to aid in the search, HaystackID, finish going through 17 boxes kept at an off-site storage facility, and for that company to issue a report on its findings and turn over any relevant documents. Engoron said he could reinstate the fine, retroactive to May 7, if the conditions he set forth are not met. He instructed Trump to pay the money directly to James' office and for the attorney general to hold the money in an escrow account while Trump's legal team appeals the original contempt finding. James asked Engoron to find Trump in contempt of court after he failed to produce any documents to satisfy a March 31 deadline to meet the terms of her subpoena. She sought documents pertaining to his annual financial statements, development projects, and even communications with Forbes magazine, where he sought to burnish his image as a wealthy businessman. One of Trump's lawyers, Alina Habba, said in a May 6 court filing that the former president responded to the subpoena completely and no relevant documents were withheld. She said Trump's team looked for records at his offices and private quarters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and his residence in Florida but didn't find anything relevant that hadn't already been produced. Her filing also detailed searches of other locations including file cabinets and storage areas at the Trump Organization's offices in New York. In a separate sworn affidavit included with the filing, Trump stated there aren't any relevant documents that haven't already been produced. He added that he owns two cell phones: an iPhone for personal use that he submitted in March to be searched as part of the subpoena, then submitted again in May; plus a second phone he was recently given that's only used to post on Truth Social, the social media network he started after his ban from Twitter, Facebook and other platforms.",True,0.806910281,,

Keeping track of vaccine side effects, the results from Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has highlighted seven of the most common side effects of the Pfizer jab. These are: pain at the injection site; fatigue; headache; myalgia – in other words, muscle pain; chills; fever; and arthralgia - i.e. joint paints. Each of these side effects were reported in more than one in 10 people involved in the trial. These set of weekly results lag behind real-time figures, with the report covering the period from December 9 to February 21. The report added that the reactions to the vaccines could be moderate in intensity, but resolved within a few days after vaccination. Adverse reactions were less frequent in older adults, aged 55 and older – predominately affecting younger people instead. READ MORE: Lung cancer symptoms: The simple finger test to find out if you’re at risk of the disease In regards to the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine, more than 23,000 participants have been involved in the Yellow Card's latest report. This injection seemingly led to more adverse side effects than the Pfizer jab. There were 10 frequently reported reactions to the jab, happening to more than one in 10 people, which included: Again, these reactions ranged from mild to moderate but passed within a few days following the injection.

The MHRA stated it's committed to continually monitor safety during widespread use of a vaccine. ""Vaccination is the single most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from COVID-19,"" said the MHRA. The number of coronavirus vaccinations in the UK is now nearing 21 million. There has been 963,862 people who have now received their second dose of the vaccine, as of March 4. As for the daily number of people testing positive for the virus, this stands at 6,573 people for the same time period. The estimated ""R"" number – the reproduction rate – has remained between 0.6 to 0.9 across the UK, suggesting the size of the pandemic is shrinking. Schools are set to return on Monday, March 8, and lots of people will be keeping their eyes on the figures. As it stands, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out a roadmap out of lockdown. This is contingent on the pandemic not putting extreme pressure on the overworked NHS. For now, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus, and those dying from the disease has been decreasing. This downward trend has also been seen in the number of patients admitted to hospital, so let's hope it stays that way.",False,0.929334564,,

SANTA FE, N.M. — A film production company is contesting sanctions by New Mexico officials for alleged workplace safety violations on the set of Rust, where actor and producer Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer in October, according to filings posted Wednesday by state regulators.Rust Movie Productions is challenging the basis of a $137,000 fine against the company by state occupational safety regulators who say production managers on the set of the Western film failed to follow standard industry protocols for firearms safety. At a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021, Baldwin was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins inside a small church during setup for the filming of a scene when it went off, killing Hutchins and wounding the director, Joel Souza.Baldwin said in a December interview with ABC News that he was pointing the gun at Hutchins at her instruction when it went off without his pulling the trigger.""The law properly permits producers to delegate such critical functions as firearm safety to experts in that field and does not place such responsibility on producers whose expertise is in arranging financing and contracting for the logistics of filming,"" Rust Movie Productions said in its filing. The company ""did not 'willfully' violate any safety protocol, and in fact enforced all applicable safety protocols.""In April, New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau imposed the maximum fine against Rust Movie Productions and distributed a scathing narrative of safety failures, including testimony that production managers took limited or no action to address two misfires of blank ammunition on set prior to the fatal shooting. The bureau also documented gun safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.Rust Movie Productions responded in its filing by saying that misfires prior to the fatal shooting of Hutchins did not violate safety protocols and that ""appropriate corrective actions were taken, including briefings of cast and crew.""""In fact, a safety meeting was held the morning of the incident,"" the company said, apparently referring to the shooting of Hutchins. The filing does not elaborate further.Rust Movie Productions also is challenging allegations that film set armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed was overburdened, asserting that she had sufficient time to properly inspect and safeguard all firearms and ammunition on set. The production company cites comments by a costume designer who said Reed had ""plenty of time"" to do her job properly.State investigators say that Gutierrez Reed was limited to eight paid days as an armorer to oversee weapons and training, and was assigned otherwise to lighter duties as a props assistant. As her time as an armorer ran out, Gutierrez Reed warned a manager and was rebuffed.The sheriff investigating the fatal film-set shooting has described disorganization and neglected safety measures in the making of the low-budget movie. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza has said he is waiting on a forensic analysis of the weapon, projectile, fingerprints and more from the FBI and state medical examiners before turning the case over to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges will be filed.State findings and sanctions against Rust Movie Productions hold implications for at least five lawsuits that have been filed over the shooting, including a wrongful death suit brought by Hutchins' family against Baldwin and the movie's other producers.The lawsuit on behalf of widower Matt Hutchins and his 9-year-old son alleges a ""callous"" disregard in the face of safety complaints on the set.The state fines would apply to a film with a budget of about $7 million. Baldwin was assigned a salary of $250,000 as an actor and producer and may have put some of that money back into the production.Rust Movie Productions says in its filing that all personnel on set were instructed that they had authority to cease activities at any time until safety concerns were resolved, with film union stewards on site to ensure compliance with labor-union safety protocols.",False,0.653368072,,

Nearly 108,000 people died in 2021 from drug overdoses. New provisional data released by the federal government estimates that nearly 108,000 people died from drug overdoses from January to December, 2021. ""That's about a 15% increase from the number of deaths in 2020,"" says Farida Ahmad, a research scientist with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Nearly 94,000 died in 2020. The year-to-year rise in overdose deaths was much higher from 2019 to 2020, jumping by a historic 30%. While the rise in deaths slowed down in 2021, the total number of deaths is still the highest annual overdose deaths ever recorded in the U.S. ""Over 80,000 of those deaths involved opioids, which was about a 15% increase from last year,"" says Ahmad. And more than 71,000 of all opioid related deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, which in recent years has been mixed in with a range of illicit drugs. ""These past three years we have seen an increase of contamination of other illicit drugs with fentanyl, be it cocaine, be methamphetamine, and more recently, illicit prescription drugs,"" says Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This has put a bigger population of drug users at risk of overdoses, she adds. ""In many instances, these may be people that take just one pill and they get that contaminated pill and they can die."" That includes teenagers, she adds, who have until recently been less likely to die from an overdose. A recent study showed that for the first time in a decade, the number of teens who died from overdoses rose in 2020. Volkow and other addiction researchers think it's primarily because fentanyl is becoming increasingly added into counterfeit prescription drugs, which are popular among this age group. ""It's absolutely devastating and heartbreaking that we continue to remain in this position,"" says Sheila Vakharia, deputy director of research and academic engagement at the Drug Policy Alliance, an addiction policy advocacy group. ""We are over 20 years in this overdose crisis and there's no sign of any kind of slowing down of deaths. If anything, things have only seemed to have gotten more dire."" In April, the Biden administration announced its plans to address the rising number of overdose deaths, including increasing access to harm reduction methods like Naloxone, the medication that reverses overdoses. Vakharia says she was heartened to see such ""historic"" investments in improving access to harm reduction measures. ""Harm reduction has historically been incredibly underfunded and has been relegated to state and local funding or private funding to sustain itself,"" she says. However, a lot more needs to happen to address the scale of the problem, she adds. There are currently just ""two legally operating above-the-ground harm reduction overdose prevention centers in the country,"" at a time when communities across the country need them, she says. ""And so I think that all of our efforts moving forward can definitely be further enhanced, can be further amplified and further ramped up,"" she adds.",False,0.547010846,,

RUTLAND, Vt. — A 28-year-old man who was rescued from a raft off the coast of New England in 2016 after his boat sank pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges he killed his mother at sea to inherit the family's estate. Nathan Carman was arraigned in federal court in Rutland on multiple fraud charges and a first-degree murder charge in the death of Linda Carman. He shouted ""not guilty"" in the direction of reporters who had asked him on his way into the courthouse whether he killed his mother. Authorities allege in the indictment unsealed Tuesday that Carman also killed his grandfather, John Chakalos, at his home in Windsor, Connecticut, in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather's estate, but he was not charged with that killing. ""As a central part of the scheme, Nathan Carman murdered John Chakalos and Linda Carman,"" the indictment reads. Carman was found in an inflatable raft eight days after leaving a Rhode Island marina to go fishing with his mother, who was never found. Prosecutors allege Carman altered the boat to make it more likely to sink that day. He has denied doing anything to intentionally make the boat unseaworthy. Carman, who was arrested Tuesday, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Linda Carman, his mother. His attorney did not comment after the arraignment. Federal prosecutors said in a court document filed Wednesday he should remain detained because he poses a flight risk and is a danger to the community. They wrote that Carman was treated for mental health issues from when he was a small child until he was 17 years old and has avoided any treatment since then. ""For an individual who would kill his own family members, nothing is off the table,"" prosecutors wrote. A hearing is scheduled for Monday. Prosecutors allege the inheritance scheme that has spanned nearly a decade began with Carman buying a rifle in New Hampshire that he used to shoot Chakalos on Dec. 20, 2013, while he slept. He then discarded his computer hard drive and the GPS unit that had been in his truck, prosecutors said. Police have said Carman was the last person to see his grandfather alive and owned a semi-automatic rifle similar to the one used to kill Chakalos — but the firearm disappeared. After Chakalos' death, Carman received $550,000 from two bank accounts that his grandfather had set up and that he was the beneficiary of when Chakalos died. He moved from an apartment in Bloomfield, Connecticut, to Vernon, Vermont, in 2014. He was unemployed much of the time and by the fall of 2016, was low on funds, prosecutors said. In September 2016, Carman arranged to go on a fishing trip with his mother on his boat named the ""Chicken Pox."" ""Nathan Carman planned to kill his mother on the trip,"" the indictment reads. ""He also planned how he would report the sinking of the 'Chicken Pox' and his mother's disappearance at sea as accidents."" Before the trip, Carman altered the boat by removing two forward bulkheads and trim tabs from the transom of the hull, the indictment states. ""After leaving the marina, Nathan Carman killed his mother, Linda Carman, and eventually sank the Chicken Pox,"" it states. In 2019, a federal judge in Rhode Island decided that Carman contributed to the sinking of the boat. U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a written decision in favor of an insurance company that had refused to pay an $85,000 claim to Carman for the loss of his 31-foot fishing boat. Carmen denied the allegations, telling the Coast Guard that when the boat filled quickly with water, he swam to the life raft and called for his mother but never saw her again. He was found floating in the raft off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, a Massachusetts island, by the crew of a freighter eight days after the boat was reported missing. Chakalos, who was a real estate developer, left behind an estate that was worth nearly $29 million, which was to be divided among his four daughters. Carman is in line to get about $7 million of the estate, as his mother's only heir. Chakalos' three surviving daughters sued Carman in New Hampshire probate court, seeking to bar him from receiving any money from Chakalos' estate. A judge dismissed the case in 2019, saying Chakalos was not a New Hampshire resident. The probate case was refiled in Connecticut, where it remains pending. William Michael, an attorney for Carman's mother's sisters, said Tuesday the family had no immediate comment.",False,0.50680868,,

Texas' highest criminal court on Wednesday ordered a lower court to take another look at the controversial case against Crystal Mason, a Texas woman who was convicted of voting illegally during the 2016 election. At the time Mason voted, she was on supervised release from prison after serving time on federal tax evasion charges. Alison Grinter Allen, Mason's attorney, has said Mason had no idea she couldn't vote because she technically hadn't finished her sentence. Mason wasn't on the voter rolls at the time, so she voted using a provisional ballot — which eventually wasn't counted. But in 2018, Mason was convicted of illegal voting, which was a second-degree felony, and was sentenced to five years of confinement. She's currently out on bond. According to the ruling from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, when a lower court upheld that conviction, it made a mistake by ""failing to require proof that [Mason] had actual knowledge that it was a crime for her to vote while on supervised release."" Tommy Buser-Clancy, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas, said in an interview that the court clarified that Texas law says the state ""has to show that the person knew that they were ineligible to vote"" when they cast a ballot. ""What this decision says is that innocent mistakes can't be prosecuted,"" he said. The case now returns to a court of appeals, where it is directed to take up this case with this new guidance from the higher court. Last year, Texas Republican lawmakers passed a controversial voting law that, among other things, cracked down on alleged voting crimes in the state. The law, known as Senate Bill 1, created new criminal penalties for people who assist voters in-person or voting by mail, and it beefed up penalties for existing voting crimes. SB 1, however, also included language aimed at preventing another case like Mason's. One of the other reasons the high criminal court wanted another review of her case is because Texas lawmakers included a provision in the law that specifies a person ""may not be convicted solely upon the fact that the person signed a provisional ballot affidavit ... unless corroborated by other evidence that the person knowingly committed the offense."" ""The amendment clarifies that a provisional ballot affidavit alone is insufficient evidence that the person MASON ― knowingly committed the offense,"" the court wrote. ""Corroboration by other evidence is required for conviction."" Voting rights advocates in the state had warned lawmakers that the legislation overall could ensnare people who make mistakes while voting. They say increased prosecutions aimed at voters could dissuade people from voting in Texas. Voting groups also worry that further criminalizing voting will disproportionately affect communities of color. Mason, as an example, is a Black woman. More than 70% of voter prosecutions conducted by the Texas attorney general's Election Integrity Unity targeted Black and Latino voters, according to a study from the ACLU of Texas published in March 2021.",False,0.517627802,,

The Los Angeles County district attorney has defended his decision to not file felony charges against the man who attacked comedian Dave Chappelle last week. Isaiah Lee, 23, remains behind bars, accused of tackling the comedian onstage at the Hollywood Bowl. Lee pleaded not guilty to four misdemeanor charges filed by a different office, that of the city attorney. LA's District Attorney George Gascón told reporters on Tuesday that Lee's behavior wasn't consistent with a felony. ""Mr. Lee was not holding a weapon when he rushed Mr. Chappelle, and we can see that by the video and we also know that from the interviews with witnesses,"" Gascón said during a news conference Tuesday. ""Security quickly separated the two men and Mr. Chappelle was not injured."" The LAPD said Lee had in his possession a replica gun with a retractable knife. The office even provided photos of the weapon. But Gascón says Lee wasn't holding it and the knife blade was always folded. Police are still investigating a possible motive for the attack that happened as Chappelle was performing during the Netflix Is A Joke festival. Audience members surreptitiously videotaped the incident with their cellphone cameras. Hollywood Bowl security guards chased the man backstage, and reportedly stamped on him before the police arrived. Gascón's new statements come days after Chappelle's attorney Gabriel Colwell blasted the decision not to file felony charges for assault with a deadly weapon, for which Lee was originally booked. ""Mr. Chappelle wants this case charged as a felony,"" Colwell told Rolling Stone. ""Ten thousand people saw Dave Chappelle assaulted on stage at the Hollywood Bowl last Tuesday night, and the assailant had a deadly weapon on him. The fact that this isn't charged as a felony case by the DA is insane.''The district attorney is facing a recall movement over his criminal justice reforms. This week, in addition to defending his decision about Lee, he announced plans to convene a roundtable to address security measures at concert venues.

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, writing on Facebook, identified the soldier as 21-year-old Vadim Shishimarin — a member of the elite 4th Guards Tank Division — and said he is currently in custody. The events in question took place Feb. 28 in Chupakhivka, a village in the Sumy region about 180 miles east of Kyiv. A pretrial investigation found that Shishimarin and four colleagues, fleeing an attack by Ukrainian defense forces, fired at and seized a private car, which they used to drive into the village. On the way, they saw a man talking on a phone while walking his bicycle along the sidewalk. Venediktova said that one of the other soldiers ordered Shishimarin to kill the civilian ""so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders."" Investigators say Shishimarin fired his Kalashnikov several times through the car window, shooting the unarmed 62-year-old in the head. ""The man died on the spot just a few dozens of meters from his house,"" she added. She said that prosecutors have collected ""enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,"" for which Shishimarin faces either 10-15 years in prison or life in prison. ""Shishimarin is actually physically in Ukraine,"" Venediktova told Ukraine's public broadcaster, according to the The Washington Post. ""We are starting a trial not in absentia, but rather directly with the person who killed a civilian, and this is a war crime."" More such trials could be on the horizon. Venediktova said last week that Russia has committed nearly 10,000 war crimes since invading Ukraine in late February. This story first appeared in the Morning Edition live blog.",False,0.643293257,,

The second semifinal is on Thursday, with the grand final set for Saturday. Ten countries advanced last night from the first round of Eurovision semi-finals to the final round of the songwriting competition, which will take place on Saturday in Turin, Italy. Among them was Ukraine, represented by rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra. The three-member group — with their iconic pink bucket hat, energetic breakdancer and colorful traditional clothing — is favored to win the competition, with bookmaker Parimatch Ukraine putting their odds at 73% on Wednesday. (Votes are cast by professional juries and viewers from the participating countries.) They received a standing ovation after last night's performance, during which Ukraine's Eurovision commentator could be seen broadcasting from a bomb shelter. And it wasn't just Ukrainian fans rooting for them: Acts from other countries, including Lithuania and Iceland, showed their support for Ukraine with statements and symbols. The rap, flute loop, the bucket hat, the breakdancing, the sparkly waistcoat. We will never be as cool as Kalush Orchestra. 🇺🇦 #Eurovision #ESC2022 pic.twitter.com/TeUmYjiI7m The core members of the group, which was founded as Kalush in 2019, are Oleh Psiuk, multi-instrumentalist Ihor Didenchuk, and dancer Vlad Kurochka, also known as MC Kilimmen. They launched Kalush Orchestra, which combines hip-hop with elements of traditional Ukrainian folk music, in 2021 with additional musicians, including Tymofii Muzychuk, Vitalii Duzhyk, and Dzhonni Dyvny. The band's Eurovision entry, ""Stefania,"" is a unique earworm combining old Ukranian melodies and traditional flute with contemporary beats and rap. The performance itself included both folk dancing and break dancing, and the musicians wore a mix of embroidered Cossack shirts and modern streetwear. Psiuk wrote ""Stefania"" about his own mother before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since then, many Ukrainians have come to associate the song — with translated lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" and ""the field blooms, but she is turning gray"" — with their own motherland. ""After it all started with the war and the hostilities, it took on additional meaning, and many people started seeing it as their mother, Ukraine, in the meaning of the country,"" Psiuk told the Associated Press last week. ""It has become really close to the hearts of so many people in Ukraine."" The song has broad popularity in countries across northern Europe, where it's climbing up several Spotify charts. While Eurovision calls itself a nonpolitical event, Russia's war in Ukraine has loomed large in the international competition. Organizers banned Russian acts back in February, and Kalush Orchestra replaced Ukraine's original contestant, Alina Pash, after the country's national broadcaster suspended her while investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea. The all-male group needed special permission from Ukrainian authorities to travel to Italy for the contest, as the country has banned men of fighting age from leaving the country. One original band member stayed behind to fight, the AP reports, and all plan to return to Ukraine after Eurovision ends. While they are hoping to boost Ukrainians' morale with a win, they have said in interviews that shining a global spotlight on the country's culture and identity is in itself a form of victory. ""We understand that we must be totally focused and concentrated, because we are here to show that Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian music exist,"" Psiuk said at a press conference, according to an English translation. ""They are alive and they have a very beautiful and special signature. So we are totally focused on this purpose.""

The Hall of Famer had worked for the league as a global ambassador. The Athletic reported in 2019 that Lanier was being treated for bladder cancer. The Milwaukee Bucks' Bob Lanier (16) moves for the basket as Philadelphia 76ers Darryl Dawkins defends during an NBA playoff game on April 13, 1981, in Milwaukee. Lanier died on Tuesday at age 73. Steve Pyle/AP hide caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Bob Lanier (16) moves for the basket as Philadelphia 76ers Darryl Dawkins defends during an NBA playoff game on April 13, 1981, in Milwaukee. Lanier died on Tuesday at age 73. Lanier played 14 seasons with the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks and averaged 20.1 points and 10.1 rebounds for his career. He is third on the Pistons' career list in both points and rebounds. Detroit drafted Lanier with the No. 1 overall pick in 1970 after he led St. Bonaventure to the Final Four. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the 6-foot-10, 250-pound Lanier was among the most talented centers in league history, and added that his accomplishments went far beyond what he did on the court. ""For more than 30 years, Bob served as our global ambassador and as a special assistant to David Stern and then me, traveling the world to teach the game's values and make a positive impact on young people everywhere,"" Silver said in a statement. ""It was a labor of love for Bob, who was one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever been around."" At 250 pounds, Lanier was considered a big man during his time and he used that bulk to his advantage. Lanier went into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. But his boat-size shoes got there ahead of him, with a display of his bronzed sneakers in the shrine. He was known for wearing size 22 shoes, although that was disputed in 1989 by a Converse representative, who told The Atlanta Constitution that Lanier wore size 18 1/2. ""The 22 he was reputed to wear was a Korean size,"" shoe rep Gary Stoken said. Not contested was the abundantly clear fact that his feet were big. ""A lot of people can put both feet into one of my shoes,"" Lanier told HOOP magazine. Born Sept. 10, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, Lanier starred in college at St. Bonaventure, where he averaged 27.6 points and 15.7 rebounds in three seasons. The Bonnies made it all the way to the Final Four in 1970, but Lanier had injured his knee in the regional final, and St. Bonaventure lost in the national semifinals to Jacksonville. Lanier overcame a litany of orthopedic injuries, dealing with shoulder, back, elbow, hand and toe problems during his career. But that didn't prevent him from earning his place among the top NBA centers of his era. After being named to the all-rookie team in 1971, he averaged at least 21 points and 11 rebounds for each of the next seven seasons. Lanier was an eight-time All-Star and the MVP of the 1974 All-Star Game. He remains the Pistons' franchise leader in scoring average at 22.7 points per game, beloved in Detroit for both his fierceness and friendliness. ""As fierce and as dominant as Bob was on the court, he was equally kind and impactful in the community,"" the Pistons said. ""As an ambassador for both the Pistons organization and the NBA, he represented our league, our franchise and our fans with great passion and integrity. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Bob's family and friends."" Lanier could beat opponents from the inside and the outside while ruling the boards. Although Abdul-Jabbar had a more famous hook shot, the sky hook, Lanier's was very much a weapon. ""Guys didn't change teams as much, so when you were facing the Bulls or the Bucks or New York, you had all these rivalries,"" Lanier told NBA.com in 2018. ""Lanier against Jabbar! Jabbar against Willis Reed! And then (Wilt) Chamberlain, and Artis Gilmore, and Bill Walton! You had all these great big men and the game was played from inside out."" As exceptional as Lanier was, the Pistons won only one playoff series with him. He played 64 games or fewer in each of his last four full seasons with Detroit. In February 1980, he was traded to Milwaukee. Lanier averaged fewer minutes with the Bucks, but he was part of Milwaukee teams that reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1983 and 1984, the final two seasons of his career. He also served as president of the players' union during the final years of his career, with Silver saying that he played ""a key role in the negotiation of a game-changing collective bargaining agreement."" Lanier was Detroit's career leader in points and rebounds before he was passed by Isiah Thomas and Bill Laimbeer in those categories, and his single-game franchise record of 33 rebounds was topped by Dennis Rodman. In 1995, Lanier was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, then took over as coach on an interim basis after Don Nelson resigned. Lanier went 12-25, and the Warriors found another coach after the season. Lanier won the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for the 1977-78 season for outstanding community service. Following his playing career, he helped start the NBA's Stay in School campaign and participated in other outreach for the league. ""There's so much need out here,"" Lanier said. ""When you're traveling around to different cities and different countries, you see there are so many people in dire straits that the NBA can only do so much. We make a vast, vast difference, but there's always so much more to do.""",True,0.556687636,,

Some abortion rights opponents express moral objections to IUDs and other birth control methods. Overturning Roe v. Wade could have implications for more than access to abortion; medical and legal experts say it could open the door to restrictions on other types of reproductive health care. ""To say that we are incredibly concerned would, I think, actually be putting it mildly,"" said Dr. Kavita Arora, chair of the ethics committee at the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists. Arora said the decision could have far-reaching implications for other types of care including birth control, emergency contraception known as Plan B, trans-affirming healthcare, and fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization, which can produce leftover embryos. ""This threatens our ability to take care of patients on a daily basis,"" Arora said. Most types of contraception prevent a sperm from fertilizing an egg. But as a second line of defense, she said some can stop an already-fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus – considered the beginning of a pregnancy. ""In changing definition of when pregnancy starts to just at fertilization, it would compromise our ability to provide access to really highly effective methods of contraception such as the copper IUD,"" Arora said. Some abortion rights opponents regard such devices as quote ""life-ending"" because of the possibility that implantation can be disrupted. Kristan Hawkins is president of the anti-abortion rights groups Students for Life of America, which is pushing for state and federal legislation to recognize human life as beginning ""at conception."" Her group takes the position that some devices and pills that can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg are ""mislabeled"" as contraception — a position at odds with the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, which defines pregnancy as beginning at implantation. ""I think legislators should be able to have the right to decide and to investigate if there are devices, if there's chemicals that are ending the lives of their citizens in their state,"" Hawkins said. In an interview last week, Hawkins denied that birth control is a focus of her movement – and called that notion a ""scare tactic."" Some Republican leaders, including a state lawmaker in Idaho, have expressed an openness to entertaining questions about the safety of contraceptives, which are tested by federal regulators before they are put on the market. Last week, a Louisiana state lawmaker proposed a bill that would classify abortion as a homicide – beginning at the moment of fertilization. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, when host Jake Tapper asked Mississippi's Republican Gov. Tate Reeves about the bill in his neighboring state, Reeves declined to rule out support for similar legislation, saying only, ""That is not what we are focused on at this time."" Under Roe, the right to an abortion is guaranteed under the right to privacy. That's also part of the rationale for the Griswold v. Connecticut decision in 1965, which recognized a right to contraception for married people – and eventually, everyone else. In his draft opinion in the major abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization which was leaked to Politico last week, Justice Samuel Alito argued that abortion is different from other rights, like contraception and marriage, because he said it destroys fetal life. But Khiara M. Bridges, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said Alito's originalist view of the Constitution offers no guarantees that women's rights will be protected. ""Because women were not part of the body politic, the rights that are important to people who can get pregnant are just not contemplated by the Constitution,"" Bridges said. ""The drafters of the Constitution could care less about what women's concerns were, what they needed in order to be fully human in society."" If the court is willing to do away with longstanding precedent like Roe, Bridges said, it's impossible to predict what other rights also could be in question.",True,0.577944849,,

Veteran journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while reporting on an Israeli army raid in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for Al Jazeera, the TV network reported on Wednesday. Al Jazeera says an Israeli force killed Abu Akleh; Israel's government says it believes she may have been hit by Palestinian gunfire. Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian American, had been covering a military raid on the Jenin refugee camp ""when she was shot in the face by a single bullet, despite wearing a press vest,"" Al Jazeera said. It said the TV correspondent had been ""assassinated in cold blood"" after she was targeted by the Israeli forces. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett issued a statement saying, ""According to the information we have gathered, it appears likely that armed Palestinians — who were firing indiscriminately at the time — were responsible for the unfortunate death of the journalist."" Al Jazeera producer Ali Samoudi was also shot while covering the raid. From his hospital bed, he told NPR that the TV network's team had arrived where Israeli soldiers were surrounding a Palestinian home in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. They walked past soldiers who allowed them to proceed, he said. The journalists were carrying camera equipment and wearing blue vests clearly marked with the word ""PRESS."" After they passed, he said, three shots rang out. Samoudi said the second shot him in the back, and the third hit Abu Akleh in the head. The producer disagreed with Israel's assessment that Palestinian gunmen were likely responsible. ""There were no resistance fighters around us,"" Samoudi said, according to a translation by Middle East Eye. ""When there are Palestinian fighters shooting, we don't go."" Another witness, Palestinian journalist Shatha Hanaysha, said journalists had been cornered when Abu Akleh was shot. Her colleague's death was an assassination, she said. ""We stood together in a collective way as journalists, then we started moving. We were shocked by the live ammunition fired at us,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""We reached an area that did not allow us to withdraw."" The gunfire came from snipers, she said. ""The one that killed Shireen was intended to kill her because he shot the bullet at an area of her body that was not protected,"" Hanaysha added. Israel's military said it ""is investigating the event and looking into the possibility that journalists were hit by the Palestinian gunmen."" The Israel Defense Forces said the raid was mounted ""to apprehend terrorist suspects"" in the Jenin camp. It acknowledges that its soldiers opened fire, but it said that only happened after ""tens of Palestinian gunmen fired at and hurled explosive devices toward the soldiers."" When the soldiers opened fire, it said, they shot ""toward the gunmen and hits were identified."" The IDF released a video that it says shows a Palestinian fighter ""recklessly opened fire"" with his rifle during Wednesday's raid, adding, ""They falsely claimed to have hit an IDF soldier."" The video does not show whether the person firing hit anyone, or where the bullets may have landed. The posting seemed to imply the gunman's bullets might have struck the journalists. But B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights monitor, said its field researcher had identified the location of Abu Akleh's death and that of the shooting — and said that the two spots are far apart. This morning, B’Tselem’s field researcher in Jenin documented the exact locations in which the Palestinian gunman depicted in a video distributed by the Israeli army, fired, as well as the exact location in which Journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. pic.twitter.com/6VbEJJuF7z Israel's prime minister called on Palestinians to ""conduct a joint pathological analysis and investigation"" with Israel into the shooting. The Palestinian Authority is instead calling for an international investigation to look into the incident, saying that Israel's official involvement would undermine an inquiry's credibility. The well-respected journalist spent decades covering conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis for Al Jazeera's Arabic service, including some of the most intense fighting during the Second Intifada of the early 2000s. Palestinians who watched Abu Akleh's reports on television did so to learn what was happening in their own backyards. Hours after her death, mourners came to pay their respects as Abu Akleh's body was moved from a hospital to be prepared for burial. Her body was covered by a Palestinian flag and a press flak jacket.

It also said the investigation into her death should be immediate and transparent. ""Her death is a tremendous loss for journalism, and the FPA offers its deepest condolences to Al Jazeera and her family,"" the association said. (Editor's note: NPR is a member of the organization.) The International Federation of Journalists also condemned the killing and demanded an investigation, as did Reporters Without Borders. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides encouraged a ""thorough investigation into the circumstances"" of the journalist's death. The Israeli soldiers involved in the raid were trying to contain violence that has been intensifying in recent weeks, Bennett said. This past weekend, a Palestinian axe attack killed three Israelis. And on Wednesday, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops had killed another Palestinian. There have also been heightened emotions because nationalist Jewish activists have been visiting and praying at a sensitive Jerusalem holy site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City. Israeli forces have been carrying out arrest raids in Palestinian villages at night. The economy in the West Bank is dismal following the pandemic, and Israeli officials are calling on their own citizens to bear arms for protection.

Here, a house is available for rent in Los Angeles on March 15. Four-dollar gasoline and five-dollar hamburger are putting a squeeze on Tanya Byron's pocketbook. But it's the rent that really stings. ""It's pretty depressing,"" says the Jacksonville, Fla., travel agent, sitting in the tiny dining room that doubles as her home office. ""I make $42,000 a year, and I can barely afford a one-bedroom apartment."" The rising costs of housing, food and other necessities are big drivers of inflation, and they fall especially hard on lower-income Americans, posing a growing challenge for President Biden and the nation's top economic policymakers. A report from the Labor Department Wednesday shows consumer prices in April were 8.3% higher than a year earlier. That's a modest decrease from the March inflation rate of 8.5%, thanks in part to a short-lived drop in gasoline prices last month. Gas prices have since rebounded to a record high, though unadjusted for inflation. But food and shelter costs remained elevated, according to the latest inflation report. In Jacksonville, apartment rents have jumped 23% in the last year, according to Realtor.com. ""I feel like there should be some kind of cap on the percentage that a landlord can raise the rent if they haven't done anything,"" says Byron, whose own apartment dates from another period of soaring prices. ""It was built in 1976, and they have not updated anything,"" she says. ""The doors and baseboards are painted brown. It's clean, but it's very basic."" Surging gasoline prices have been a main driver of inflation in recent months. Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Surging gasoline prices have been a main driver of inflation in recent months. Byron had hoped to move into a condo by now, but with real estate prices climbing rapidly and mortgage rates topping 5.25%, buying a home feels out of reach. ""I'm genuinely worried about the future,"" Byron says. ""What's going to happen to the people making $15 and $18 an hour and the single mothers and people who have mouths to feed? It's very scary to me."" When inflation is high, everyone pays the price, but research suggests that lower-income families suffer the most. ""Typically food and gasoline and housing are a bigger share of total spending for lower-income households than for higher-income households,"" says Dan Sichel, an economist at Wellesley College. There's another critical factor, Sichel adds. Those with lower incomes tend to pay higher prices, even for similar items. They may be less able to travel to cheaper stores, take advantage of seasonal discounts or ""get the giant package of toilet paper to stash in the basement when it's on sale."" Sichel chaired a committee from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that recommended the Labor Department try to reflect those realities as part of an effort to modernize the way the government measures the cost of living. ""What people are paying for similar items at different stores is very important for understanding inflation inequality,"" Sichel says. Tackling inflation remains a top priority for the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration. Here, a customer shops at a grocery store in Miami on Feb. 10. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Tackling inflation remains a top priority for the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration. Here, a customer shops at a grocery store in Miami on Feb. 10. The committee recommended other ways to improve the way the government measures inflation, including more frequent updates to the basket of goods and services used to track prices. Right now, the basket is adjusted only once every two years. That can miss big swings in consumption patterns like those that have occurred during the coronavirus pandemic, when Americans suddenly bought fewer movie tickets but more streaming subscriptions, for example. Any effort to update the inflation measure is likely to attract outsize attention at a time when the consumer price index is front-page news. ""I think the stakes are very high right now,"" Sichel says. Biden, whose approval ratings have fallen as prices climb, calls fighting inflation his top domestic priority. ""I know that families all across America are hurting,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""I know you've got to be frustrated. I know. I can taste it."" The president blamed pandemic-related supply chain snarls and the war in Ukraine as the leading causes of inflation. While the administration has tried to offset price hikes with oil releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and other moves, Biden says the Federal Reserve has a primary role to play in bringing down inflation.

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images hide caption President Biden announces he's nominating Jerome Powell to serve a second term as Fed chair during an event at the White House on Nov. 22, 2021. Chris Waller, who sits on the Fed's governing board, agrees. ""Inflation's too high and my job is to get it down,"" Waller said Tuesday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. ""We have to raise [interest] rates. We have to cool off demand and try to get inflation pressures down. If we get some help from supply chain resolutions, that's fantastic, but I'm not counting on it."" The Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage point last week and signaled that two more jumbo rate hikes are likely in June and July. Waller and his Fed colleagues argue that the economy and job market are strong enough to weather a rise in interest rates without a sharp jump in unemployment. But Waller concedes that if layoffs happen, they're likely to hurt the same people who are already most affected by rising prices. ""We're trying to lower the inflation tax on everybody, but there's a small section of the society that may bear the brunt of that by losing their jobs,"" Waller says. ""There is no magical formula in a textbook that tells you how to do it. You kind of have to take your chances and see where it goes.""",True,0.649110044,"05/11/2022, 22:20:24","05/11/2022, 22:20:27"
,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-schiff-visit-epsteins-island/,www.snopes.com,/fact-check/did-schiff-visit-epsteins-island/,"In February 2021, America’s Last Line of Defense published an article positing that “visitor logs to Epstein Isle” revealed that U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., had visited the private island of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein: Leaked Visitor Logs Reveal Schiff’s 78 Visits to Epstein Isle It’s no secret that Epstein and Schiff share a long history of perversion. Last year, it was revealed by the FBI that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. But, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails. The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons. An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years. However, this item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows: Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. The additional claim (in the above excerpt) that Schiff and Epstein frequently corresponded via email (256 emails in all, allegedly) is also a fabrication, originally published in a separate article on the same website. For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor. Company Navigate Sections Account © 1995 - 2022 by Snopes Media Group Inc. This material may not be reproduced without permission.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., had visited the private island of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein: Leaked Visitor Logs Reveal Schiff’s 78 Visits to Epstein Isle It’s no secret that Epstein and Schiff share a long history of perversion. Last year, it was revealed by the FBI that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. But, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails. The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons. An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years. However, this item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows: Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. The additional claim (in the above excerpt) that Schiff and Epstein frequently corresponded via email (256 emails in all, allegedly) is also a fabrication, originally published in a separate article on the same website. For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor. Company Navigate Sections Account © 1995 - 2022 by Snopes Media Group Inc. This material may not be reproduced without permission.

,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2022/05/11/judge-trump-must-pay-110k-meet-conditions-to-end-contempt/,www.snopes.com,/ap/2022/05/11/judge-trump-must-pay-110k-meet-conditions-to-end-contempt/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A New York judge said Wednesday he will lift his contempt of court order issued against Donald Trump if the former president meets certain conditions, including paying $110,000 in fines racked up for being slow to respond to a subpoena issued by the state’s attorney general. Judge Arthur Engoron said he will conditionally lift Trump’s contempt finding if, by May 20, Trump submits additional paperwork detailing efforts to search for the subpoenaed records and explaining his and his company’s document retention policies. The judge also requires that a company Trump hired to aid in the search complete its work. Engoron found Trump in contempt on April 25 and fined him $10,000 per day for not complying with a subpoena for documents issued by New York Attorney General Letitia James. James, a Democrat, says her investigators have uncovered evidence that Trump’s company misstated the value of assets like skyscrapers and golf courses on financial statements for over a decade. Trump has denied the allegations, calling James investigation “racist” and a “witch hunt.” James is Black. The total Engoron ordered Trump to pay is the amount of fines accrued through last Friday, when Trump’s lawyers submitted 66 pages of court documents detailing the efforts by him and his lawyers to locate the subpoenaed records. Engoron could reinstate the fine if the conditions he set forth on Wednesday are not met. Also Wednesday, a state appellate court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in Trump’s appeal in another subpoena matter: Engoron’s Feb. 17 ruling requiring him to answer questions under oath in James’ investigation. A message seeking comment was left with Trump’s lawyer. James asked Engoron to hold Trump in contempt of court after he failed to produce any documents to satisfy a March 31 deadline to meet the terms of the subpoena. James’ office sought numerous documents, including paperwork and communications pertaining to Trump’s financial statements, financing and debt for a Chicago hotel project and development plans for his Seven Springs Estate north of New York City, and even communications with Forbes magazine, where he sought to burnish his image as a wealthy businessman. Trump attorney Alina Habba said in the May 6 filing that the responses to the subpoena were complete and correct and that no relevant documents or information were withheld. Habba conducted searches of Trump’s offices and private quarters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, according to the filing, but didn’t find any relevant documents that hadn’t already been produced. The filing also detailed searches of other locations including file cabinets and storage areas at the Trump Organization’s offices in New York. In a separate sworn affidavit included with the filing, Trump stated there aren’t any relevant documents that haven’t already been produced. He added that he owns two cellphones: an iPhone for personal use that he submitted in March to be searched as part of the subpoena, then submitted again in May; plus a second phone he was recently given that’s only used to post on Truth Social, the social media network he started after his ban from Twitter, Facebook and other platforms. Engoron’s criteria for lifting the contempt finding were largely in line with conditions James’ office outlined in its response Monday to the lengthy filing last week in which Trump and his legal team said they had exhausted efforts to find the subpoenaed records. Those conditions sought by James’ office were: Trump submitting another affidavit detailing his and his company’s retention and destruction policies for his documents and electronic devices; and allowing the outside firm Trump hired, HaystackID, to finish going through 17 boxes kept at an off-site storage facility, and for that company to issue a report on its findings and turn over any relevant documents.

The Women's Health Protection Act, a Democrat-led bill that would effectively codify a right to an abortion, failed to pass, as expected, after it did not reach the Senate's 60-vote threshold. All Democrats voted for the legislation except Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and all Republicans opposed the bill. In a rare occurrence, Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the vote, which was 49-51. Within minutes of the vote, President Joe Biden released a statement that ""this failure to act comes at a time when women's constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack – and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people."" ""We will continue to defend women's constitutional rights to make private reproductive choices as recognized in Roe v. Wade nearly half a century ago, and my Administration will continue to explore the measures and tools at our disposal to do just that,"" Biden said, without providing details. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week the Senate would be a vote on the bill after a leaked draft opinion from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito revealed that the court is likely to overturn the 50-year-old protections of abortion rights granted under the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. Because it was never likely to pass, the vote was effectively symbolic. ""I think it's really important to have this vote to show where everyone stands,"" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NPR on Tuesday. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's comments over the weekend that Republicans might try to move legislatively on a nationwide abortion ban also upped the stakes for Democrats. The draft opinion from the court would not issue a national ban, but it would allow states to do so. Focus could now turn to efforts from more moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who are drafting a narrower approach to the WHPA legislation. That bill would also aim to codify Roe in some form, but it has restrictions that many Democrats do not support. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said he's having ""productive discussions"" with Collins about that legislation but he acknowledged that even that bill, should it come together, would not immediately have enough support to pass. ""I've worked on things with Lisa and Susan before and negotiated and often find an answer that we can live with,"" Kaine said. ""So I'm in that spirit. That's the spirit of the discussions."" And while the WHPA failed to pass Wednesday, Democrats did manage to get support from Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who said on Tuesday he would vote in favor of the legislation. Casey is one of the few anti-abortion Democrats in office. His father, Bob Casey Sr., was Pennsylvania governor during the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which upheld Roe but paved the way for abortion restrictions. In a statement, the younger Casey said the circumstances around abortion rights in the country have changed over the last few months. He cited the leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court and the possibility that Republicans might try to codify a national ban on abortions. ""During my time in public office, I have never voted for — nor do I support — such a ban,"" Casey said.",True,0.8589238907266705,"05/12/2022, 00:51:34","05/12/2022, 00:51:36"

Local police believe that a man in Trenton, S.C., died of a heart attack while attempting to bury the body of a woman he killed. Investigators in South Carolina have made a breakthrough in an unusual homicide case involving a man who they believe killed a woman in his backyard — then suffered a heart attack and died as he attempted to bury her. Local sheriff's deputies and paramedics say they were initially called to the house in Trenton, S.C., after receiving a report of an unresponsive man lying in his yard. When they arrived at the scene, they found the collapsed body of Joseph McKinnon, 60. Also nearby: the body of Patricia Ruth Dent, 65, wrapped in trash bags, lying in a freshly dug pit. While investigators believed McKinnon may have died of natural causes, they immediately suspected foul play in Dent's death. That scenario was confirmed this week by the coroner, whose autopsy report found that McKinnon had suffered a cardiac arrest and Dent had been strangled. The pair had been living together at the address in a rural area of Trenton, the sheriff's office said. ""Evidence gathered at the scene, along with statements from witnesses aided investigators to build a timeline, leading us to believe that Mr. McKinnon attacked Ms. Dent while inside their home,"" Sheriff Jody Rowland and Coroner David Burnett of Edgefield County said in a joint statement sent to NPR. ""Mr. McKinnon then bound her and wrapped her in trash bags before putting her in the previously dug pit,"" the statement said. ""The pit was then partially filled in by Mr. McKinnon. While covering the pit, Mr. McKinnon had the cardiac event, causing his death."" Dent's twin sister, Pamela Briggs, told local TV station WRDW that she was shocked by her sister's death. ""Everybody who ever met her liked her. She was just full of energy. She was 65 and working,"" she said. Dent worked at the nearby Mount Vintage Golf Club, according to the incident report. Her body wasn't immediately discovered when first responders were called about McKinnon. Deputies began looking for Dent after a deputy coroner found her wallet at her home on Saturday. At the time, they were starting the process of investigating and notifying loved ones of McKinnon's death. But then the golf course confirmed that Dent hadn't come to work or called in on Saturday, prompting investigators to take a closer look at the large hole dug in the garden area of the yard, where Dent's body was found.",False,0.6754600414566181,"05/12/2022, 00:51:46","05/12/2022, 00:51:47"
